This issue disappears in incognito mode, however, and i can use the extension just fine.    Chrome version: 87.0.4280.141  Extension version: 4.10.1  React version: 16.13.1    I've been unable to find anyone else with this issue.  Please let me know if there is other information I can provide you with.  Thank you."

        "description": "Hi. I have a recurring scenario that I\u2019ve been struggling with since the good old days of `componentWillReceiveProps`, and now I\u2019ve pretty much run into the same issue with hooks, so I was hoping I could get some guidance as to what the idiomatic way of solving this and similar cases in React is.\r\n\r\n### Problem description - starting point\r\n\r\nI have a list of items. Every item has an Edit button next to it. Clicking it opens an \u201cEditor\u201d, where one can change all the fields and either Confirm or Cancel. (Confirming would send an API call to save the data, but this part is not relevant to the problem I am having.) The \u201cparent\u201d component would render the list with the Edit buttons, and have an `itemUnderEdit` property that would be null from the start. Clicking on \u201cEdit\u201d for a specific item would set the `itemUnderEdit` to the clicked item.\r\n\r\n![usecase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5010901/56883590-6cbcd080-6a67-11e9-9401-bd44e1747bc2.gif)\r\n\r\nHere is the full example with all 3 solutions on CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/2oz2nzynpy\r\n\r\n### Solution 1\r\n\r\nMake the \u201cEditor\u201d component stateless and controlled - it takes in change handlers for every field as props with the parent tracking every change. This solution appeals to me, since I like pure stateful components that are a one-to-one mapping of props to HTML - they are simple to reason about etc etc. This kind of goes against the commonly heard \u201ckeep your state close to where it is used\u201d advice, which also seems reasonable, since I don\u2019t really need to know in the parent what the user is typing, I am only interested to know when they are done at the end. This stateless solution also introduces a lot of props, since I need one event handler per field (onNameChanged, onDescriptionChanged in the example, but it could as well be 10 fields), which is a lot of props.\r\n\r\n### Solution 2\r\n\r\nMake the \u201cEditor\u201d component stateful and only get an event when editing is done: `onConfirm(itemToSave)` or `onCancel()`. This seems like the \u201cReact\u201d way and is in line with the advice of keeping state close to where it is used. Since I am only interested to know when the user clicks `Confirm`, a stateful \u201cblackbox\u201d-component that tracks its own state seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, however, I need to copy my props to the state, which, according to @gaearon, is a bad idea:\r\n```\r\nconst [name, setName] = useState(props.item.name);\r\nconst [description, setDescription] = useState(props.item.description);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, this solution is buggy from the start, since clicking on Edit for a different item doesn\u2019t \u201cre-sync\u201d the props with the state - it only works if I close the Editor and then reopen it:\r\n\r\n![stateful_editor1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5010901/56877667-e2b53d80-6a4f-11e9-8f4c-6a52fa175abd.gif)\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to Solution 3.\r\n\r\n### Solution 3\r\n\r\nThis one has been one of my biggest pain-points with stateful components in React (which is why I prefer stateless components with a state container, but those I widely demonized nowadays, so I am yet again trying to understand the idiomatic React way of doing this).\r\nThe \u201cold\u201d ways were to sync in `componentWillReceiveProps` and later with `getDerivedStateFromProps`. Now I can do this with `useEffect`, where I specify `props.item` as the \u201cdependency\u201d, since I want to run it when the item changes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if (props.item.name !== name) {\r\n    setName(props.item.name);\r\n  }\r\n  if (props.item.description !== description) {\r\n    setDescription(props.item.description);\r\n  }\r\n}, [props.item]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to work as expected, but I get the linter warning: `React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'description' and 'name'. Either include them or remove the dependency array  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. Obviously if I were to add those to the dependency list, I wouldn\u2019t be able to change anything in the inputs, so how come I get this warning?\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a question in two parts: first one about an idiomatic solution in React, as well as feedback to the React team: this scenario is simple and common, but *it\u2019s difficult to know how to implement correctly and safely in a consistent way*.\r\n\r\nLifting state up and making the problematic component stateless is good advice that solves the problem, but every time it seems like a \u201ctemporary\u201d solution. It also leads to painful refactoring every time something has to be moved around the component tree, so relying on it in the long run is extremely brittle.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the question is whether the solution with `useEffect` is viable at all, and in this case - why do I get the linter warning? Clearly I want to run it **only** when a certain prop changes. Is there an edge-case where this would result in an unexpected bug? ",

This relates to Hooks.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that this is all expected behaviour and one of the workarounds mentioned is required.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI have a hook that depends on the `useContext` hook. Using it as follows works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyHookedComponent = () => {\r\n    const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext);\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n       //Do something with contextValue\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                <MyHookedComponent />\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if I want to use the `getContext` hook inline in the same component that declares the `DemoContext.Provider` ?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MyContextProviderComponent = () => {\r\n       const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext); //Of course this fails due to the Context hierarchy.\r\n   return (\r\n        <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>\r\n                     //Do something with contextValue\r\n         </DemoContext.Provider>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI seem to be unable to get this working.\r\n\r\n**Please note**:\r\n- I have a very good reason for solving my issue with Context and not passing props.\r\n- The implementation I show above looks trivial and dumb but it is the simplest way to illustrate what the use case is. In my implementation the `Provider` sits in a complex component that does a lot of data management which I really want to happen at this level.\r\n- The usual way to use this will be the first working version I noted above, it is only in the case where the user would want to use the hook inline inside the `Provider`.\r\n- I have searched for a couple of hours and tried various configurations without success, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of another issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAny method to consume context inline in the provider using the same re-usable hook without having to revert back to render props.\r\n\r\nI know I can solve this with **render props** but I am trying to convert an implementation using render props to hooks.

It could also be that this is all expected behaviour and one of the workarounds mentioned is required.    **What is the current behavior?**    I have a hook that depends on the `useContext` hook. Using it as follows works perfectly:    ```  const MyHookedComponent = () => {      const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext);        return (         //Do something with contextValue      )  }    const MyContextProviderComponent = () => {       return (          <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>                  <MyHookedComponent />           </DemoContext.Provider>     )  }  ```    What if I want to use the `getContext` hook inline in the same component that declares the `DemoContext.Provider` ?    ```  const MyContextProviderComponent = () => {         const contextValue = useContext(DemoContext); //Of course this fails due to the Context hierarchy.     return (          <DemoContext.Provider value={someContextValue}>                       //Do something with contextValue           </DemoContext.Provider>     )  }  ```    I seem to be unable to get this working.    **Please note**:  - I have a very good reason for solving my issue with Context and not passing props.  - The implementation I show above looks trivial and dumb but it is the simplest way to illustrate what the use case is. In my implementation the `Provider` sits in a complex component that does a lot of data management which I really want to happen at this level.  - The usual way to use this will be the first working version I noted above, it is only in the case where the user would want to use the hook inline inside the `Provider`.  - I have searched for a couple of hours and tried various configurations without success, so my apologies if this is a duplicate of another issue.    **What is the expected behavior?**    Any method to consume context inline in the provider using the same re-usable hook without having to revert back to render props.    I know I can solve this with **render props** but I am trying to convert an implementation using render props to hooks. I also know I can hoist the Context Provider higher up but in my implementation it would quadruple the code complexity to develop and maintain while introducing extra complexity into the user interface.    Also, by extracting the body inside the `Provider` to a new component I can also solve this but ideally I would not like to have a user do this for this use case."

I want to use it like this:  ``` javascript // Scalable.js // Example of AOP-style decorating component import React from 'react'  const Scalable = ({children}) =>   const scaledData = children.props.data.map(e => e + 1) // example 'transformation'   children.props.data = scaledData   {children}  // this is what i want  Scalable.propTypes = {   children: React.PropTypes.element.isRequired } ```  ``` javascript // ScalablePlot.js // plug <Scalable /> to transform data passed to <Plot /> // and render <Plot /> with transformed data import React from 'react'  const ScalablePlot = ({data}) =>   <Scalable>     <Plot data={data} />   </Scalable> ```  ``` js // Plot.js import React from 'react'  const Plot = ({data}) ->   //paint plot using data  Plot.propTypes = {   data: React.PropTypes.arrayOf(React.PropTypes.number) } ```  However, when i do this, react renders child element without data props. # UPD  Solution: should have used [React.cloneElement](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.cloneelement)"

In particularly, I have a Dust.js template that is rendered this way in a controller:  ``` router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {     res.render('index', {         title: 'Title',         page: 'index',         foo: 'Foo'     }); }); ```  I compile and concat my `js` assets in one `app.js` file and include it in my template like this:  ```         <script src=\"/js/app.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\" async></script>     </body> </html> ```  And now I want to know how to use React on a server. How I need to change my current routine to compile/render react AND my template on a server.  For now when I use `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup` I get these errors and I don't know what does it mean because React documentation doesn't have any errors explanations:  `Error: Invariant Violation: renderToStaticMarkup(): You must pass a valid ReactElement.` `TypeError: Cannot read property '__reactAutoBindMap' of undefined`"

When you press enter in any field, it moves your focus to the next one by talking to a register which keeps track of all the fields and their positions. Shift+enter goes in reverse as well.\n\nIf you press enter on the final field, it kicks off a Flux like action which results in the next blank field being rendered, and then I want to move focus to that row. So I set up a callback that will fire on the next componentDidUpdate, knowing that when that happens, I'll have access to the new Field, which registers itself during componentWillMount. That works just fine, I can access that component just fine, however, if I want to use a method to direct focus to a DOM Element within it, it will be too early to make use of references:\n\n``` js\nconst FieldComponent = React.createClass({\n  receiveFocus: function() {\n    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs.input).focus() // error: this.refs.input == undefined\n  },\n  render: function() {\n    return React.DOM.div({},\n      React.DOM.label({}, \"Some Label\"),\n      React.DOM.input({ref: \"input\", type: \"text\"})\n    )\n  }\n})\n```\n\n...because the references have not yet been bound, even though we're at the componentDidMount/Update stage of the lifecycle, so this...\n\n``` js\n  receiveFocus: function() {\n    console.log(Object.keys(this.refs)) // log: []\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      console.log(Object.keys(this.refs)) // log: [\"input\"]\n    },  0)\n  },\n```\n\n...seems to indicate that reference binding happens synchronously after.
