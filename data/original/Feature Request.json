Beyond just JSON we also support all React primitives (React.lazy, ReactNode) and global named symbols (Symbol.for).

This is mostly just an implementation detail for the perf cost whether something should be inlined as JSON or defined as a separate row.\r\n- [ ] ArrayBuffer: For Typed Arrays we might stick to using the underlying buffer coming from the stream instead of cloning the data. All values are considered immutable anyway. For ArrayBuffers we can't use that trick though so it would require a new clone of the data which might be a bit of a foot gun when switching between buffers and typed arrays.\r\n- [ ] Error objects: We already support thrown errors and we could support more errors in the encoding. However, we intentionally don't pass them through with all information. We cover them up with digests since the error message and stack can sometimes include sensitive information that only the server should have access to. We would likely have to do the same here.\r\n- [ ] Boolean/String objects: We don't currently support the object wrappers around primitives e.g. `new String()`. You're not really supposed to use these in modern JS so it's kind of annoying to have to add extra code to handle this case.\r\n- [ ] RegExp: These are pretty straightforward but can possibly have security implications.\r\n- [x] Date, Map, Set: These are fairly straightforward to serialize so it's mostly a matter of allowing these as special cases. Why are these special? Because Structured Clone says so.\r\n- [ ] (Temporal: It seems appropriate that this would be added to structured clone but we need to confirm.)\r\n\r\nWe probably won't support Web specific APIs that don't necessarily have an equivalent on the Server or isn't directly transferrable such as if it has handles to local hardware or file system resources. The only one that might be easy to support:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Blob: This would be a wrapper around a ReadableStream with a mime type.\r\n- [ ] (File: This is just a Blob with a modified time and file name. I think we'll likely want to only support Blobs and not Files, meaning that File object would serialize as Blob, so the receiving type has to be Blob. Because file names and modified times could have security implications and it's too easy to accidentally leak this data.)"

        "description": "# Background\r\nCurrently, the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` linting rule allows developers to lint custom hooks. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"rules\": {\r\n    // ...\r\n    \"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": [\"warn\", {\r\n      \"additionalHooks\": \"(useMyCustomHook|useMyOtherCustomHook)\"\r\n    }]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) for this configuration states \"We suggest to use this option **very sparingly, if at all**\", there are nonetheless certain custom hook cases that necessitate such an approach. Consider the following scenario: (1) a callback needs to hook into an external system (thus requiring an effect), (2) the callback has dependencies on state / props and needs to reexecute when those change, (3) executing that callback can be arbitrarily expensive, so re-executing every render is not an option.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nTo meet this challenge, we have two options: (1) treat the callback reference as sufficiently reactive (by this I mean, referentially stable unless a dependency has changed) \u2014 in other words, we assume the user of the hook is passing in a callback that was defined via useCallback, with the appropriate dependencies; (2) accept dependencies in the custom hook itself, wrap the function in a `useEvent` / `useEventHandler` style hook for referential stability, apply the dependencies to whatever effect the function is then executed within.\r\n\r\nIf we go with option (1) we have an obvious shortcoming \u2014 there's no way to ensure the user is wrapping their callback in useCallback. From personal experience on a large industry project with lots of developers, this is just not a viable option. Option (2) on the other hand meets all our needs, and via the `additionalHooks` config, we can ensure correctness by linting for exhaustive dependencies.\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\nGreat! We've met our challenge with a robust solution and easy to use solution, however...... what if our hook accepts a third, or fourth arg? Well, the [current implementation](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/ExhaustiveDeps.js#L1737) of exhaustive-deps only allows for the [callback, deps] args to occupy arg0 and arg1 of our custom hook (e.g., `useCustomHook(effectCallback, effectDeps)`). While we can still get everything to \"work\", this because more than a minor headache if a hypothetical arg2 we want to add contains some of the most important contextual information. This pain is particularly acute because callbacks are (preferably) defined inline within hooks, and so they'll have a tendency push any succeeding args pretty far down, making them almost seem irrelevant.\r\n\r\n## An example from React\r\nWhile this is ultimately an issue of style, the resulting requirement forces custom hooks that need the exhaustive deps rule into a very awkward argument pattern. It seems I'm not alone, as React's own [`useImperativeHandle`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useimperativehandle) seems to agree in the preferred structure for hooks that accept effectful callbacks with deps. In the case of useImperativeHandle, the most important, unique, and concise value \u2014 the `ref` \u2014 is passed first, and only then followed by the more verbose and less information-dense callback + deps args.\r\n\r\n## The Proposal\r\nAllowing developers to add their custom hooks to the linting tool is genuinely useful, but it does come with the significant caveat that the effect and deps have to be used as the first two args. I propose either of the following revisions:\r\n\r\n1. The additionalHooks rule be modified to alternatively accept an object of the form `{ [callbackArgIndex: number]: customHookRegex }`. For instance, adding a rule for `useImperativeHandle` would look like\r\n```\r\n\"additionalHooks\": { 1: \"useImperativeHandle\" }\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Instead, the behavior of the rule should be altered to assume that the callback and the dependencies occupy the final two arguments of any given custom hook. This pattern seems consistent with how all native hooks with callback-deps patterns are defined, and so it seems to be a better \"default assumption\" over the current approach. \r\n\r\nIf this proposal is not moved forward with, I highly recommend that the documentation for the linting rule at least be updated to clarify that the linted callback and dependencies must occupy the first two arguments of any custom hook. Mine was failing silently and it took a deep dive into the implementation to understand what was going on!"

No indent for single child\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to just not indent when there is only one child.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  h\r\n  Context.Provider - {props: {foo: 1}}\r\n  I\r\n  Context.Provider\r\n  E\r\n  Context.Provider\r\n  Context.Provider\r\n  Context.Provider\r\n  l\r\n- Context.Provider (2 children - collapse all)\r\n\r\n    mg\r\n    d\r\n    Context.Provider\r\n  + Component (1 child - expand all)\r\n\r\n    vg\r\n    hg\r\n    Context.Provider\r\n  + hg (1 child - expand all)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could also indicate when there are multiple children and provide some controls to collapse all the children's children. This would help with https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16463.\r\n\r\nAdvantage: As another feature I'd also be interested in adding some inline annotations to the right of each component to show some props to better identify components. Moving these nested trees horizontal would block this ability, so this approach works better.\r\n\r\nDesign decision: Where to place the arrow to toggle folding? At the first element with multiple children (indicated above)? Or at the top. Or maybe we can create a really tall button on hover to show.\r\n\r\nDesign decision: How to clearly and visually deliniate that the components are nested vs siblings. Maybe we need to add an extra space (as shown in example above). Maybe color coding as well. Or alternate grey shading.\r\n\r\n# Related\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16463\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16735\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But if this code is repeated or reused anywhere in the tree, we trigger  [layout thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing). The severity of the layout thrashing scales linearly with the number of hooks/components featuring either this code or code like it.\r\n\r\nHooks and components are designed to be composable, yet it's this trivial to write one that isn't. \r\n\r\nInstead, what I'd like is a batched version of `useLayoutEffect` that provides `read` and `write` callbacks. These schedule callbacks that will be called:\r\n\r\n1. Synchronously before paint\r\n2. In \"parallel\" in reads/writes/reads etc\r\n3. After all child components in the tree have run `useLayoutEffect` - including those entering the tree (currently these don't mount until after other `useLayoutEffect`s have been called)\r\n\r\nIt could look like this, though I'm more interested in the above specs than actual API:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseBatchedLayoutEffect((read, write) => {\r\n  write(() =>  {\r\n    ref.current.style.transform = \"\"\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  read(() => {\r\n    const box = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect()\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, adhering the 3 specifications above, these callbacks are executed in order, so all `read`s from across the tree, then all `write`s, then all `read`s etc. There is no upper limit for the number of permitted ping-ponged reads/writes IMO as the amount of layout thrashing you could possibly suffer will never be worse than the single hungriest hook. In my experience I've never needed more than a read/write/read/write.\r\n\r\n## Measurement accuracy\r\n\r\nIn the given example, we're measuring a component after first resetting its `transform` because we want to snapshot its actual bounding box without any transforms applied. But if this component is [nested in itself](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-varahamihira-2qiyw?file=/src/App.js), so both a parent and child are performing the same type of animation, we want to unset all the transforms before measuring any of the elements, otherwise the resulting measurements will be incorrect.\r\n\r\n## What about `requestAnimationFrame`?\r\n\r\nTheoretically it could be possible to implement this ourselves in userland by creating a batcher that executes on the next available frame. Sadly this isn't possible in practise. For whatever browser-internal reason it is necessary to run these reads and writes synchronously to prevent flashes of incorrectly-styled components.\r\n\r\nIf you play with this very simple layout animation implementation by clicking on the red box you'll see it suffers no flashes:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/broken-star-cycfz?file=/src/App.js:528-537\r\n\r\nBut if you uncomment the wrapping `requestAnimationFrame` within the `useLayoutEffect` you'll see it does randomly flash with the undesired styles."

        "description": "This is regarding the discussion in #17773. \r\n\r\nReact-DOM currently stringifies DOM attribute values  before passing them to `Element.setAttribute(NS)` functions. This might be unnecessary, as these functions implicitly stringify attribute values on their own (WebIDL attributes typed as `DOMString`). It also makes it difficult to enforce [Trusted Types](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/) in React applications, as the trusted type objects would be stringified before values reach the DOM sinks.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a `enableTrustedTypesIntegration` feature flag to disable stringification, but it seems like this behavior can be safely removed for modern browsers with no backwards-compatibility problems. Let me explain:\r\n\r\nAttribute stringification was introduced in https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/b0455f46709fca94da0b6126b719d6dd07605e65, at that time to workaround a [**jsdom**](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) limitation (jsdom's DOM emulation didn't stringify on its own). **IE 8/9** [have a similar issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/3b94abcb3b2c05fc38406b02a501427e58377c44). If an object is passed to a DOM attribute, its value becomes `[object]`, ignoring any stringification rules defined in objects' `toString` function.\r\n\r\n- Jsdom does not have the issue anymore. Since at least 4.0.0 its `setAttribute` function does stringify the values via its IDL layer ([runkit demo](https://runkit.com/kkotowicz/jsdom-setattribute)).\r\n- React doesn't support IE 8 anymore.\r\n- The issue still exists for IE9 (contrary to https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11735, my tests confirm that the bug still exists, but one needs to try a standard attribute, like `p.title`, and not one with a custom name).\r\n- All other browsers, even in their old versions (I tested IEs, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera and a few mobile browsers ) correctly stringify.\r\n\r\nI propose to remove the stringification (similar to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17774) unless a browser bug is detected. \r\n\r\nThat way there is no spurious stringification, and the code branches with the workaround can be removed once buggy browsers stop being supported. My testing shows that only IE9 is affected. The change would be backwards-compatible. I'll send a PR with the proposed change."

These details are defined in the reconciler:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  commitUpdate(instance: any, updatePayload: any, type: string, oldProps: any, newProps: any, fiber: Reconciler.Fiber)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf libraries could use this knowledge from outside they could deal with any platform.

Thank you for everything you are doing!\r\n\r\nRegarding the `Suspense` component, could it be nice to have a property (both in Concurrent Mode and in \"normal/synchronous\" mode) which would allow us to set the minimum duration of the `Suspense` fallback UI in case the fallback UI ever gets rendered?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nLet me do an example. Try clicking on the `Next` button in this codesandbox: \r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/cold-monad-ifr29.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the `Suspense` fallback UI is rendered and stays in the tree just for a little moment (`~200ms`) because both promises resolve in `1200ms`, while `useTransition` has a `timeoutMs` of 1 second.\r\nIn my opinion, this is a bit unpleasant to the eye.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nicer if we could tell the `Suspense` component something like \"If you ever render the fallback, show it for at least N millisec.\"? E.g.:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n...\r\nfunction ProfilePage({ resource }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading profile...</h1>}\r\n      // If the fallback ever gets rendered,\r\n      // it will be shown for at least 1500 millisec.,\r\n      // even if the promise resolves right after rendering the fallback.\r\n      fallbackMinDurationMs={1500}>\r\n      <ProfileDetails resource={resource} />\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading posts...</h1>}>\r\n        <ProfileTimeline resource={resource} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider an animated spinner used as a fallback of `Suspense`, if it happens that the promise resolves just a few milliseconds after rendering the fallback like above, the spinner will be rendered and suddenly disappear, without completing its animation cycle and showing an incomplete animation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, if we could keep the spinner in the tree for at least `fallbackMinDurationMs` millisec. once rendered, we could improve its appearance in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe `Suspense` component responsible for rendering the fallback would have to wrap the caught Promise in a promise which would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction maxDelayFallbackPromise({\r\n  promise,\r\n  timeoutMs, // ---> This would be the value of `useTransition`'s `timeoutMs`\r\n  onFallback = () => {}, // ---> This code would run in case `timeoutMs` exceeds (i.e. when `Suspense`'s fallback UI is rendered)\r\n  fallbackMinDurationMs\r\n} = {}) {\r\n  // Generate a unique identifier, like a string, a number, in order to identify which promise resolves first...\r\n  const uniqueIdentifier = `promise_value_${Math.random()}`\r\n  return Promise.race([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(timeoutMs).then(() => uniqueIdentifier)\r\n  ]).then(value => {\r\n    if (value === uniqueIdentifier) {\r\n      onFallback()\r\n      return minDelayPromise(promise, fallbackMinDurationMs)\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      return value\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `timeout` and `minDelayPromise` are:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction timeout(delayMs) {\r\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs))\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction minDelayPromise(promise, minDelay) {\r\n  return Promise.all([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(minDelay)\r\n  ]).then(([value]) => {\r\n    return value\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also apply to the `isPending` flag of `useTransition`...\r\n\r\nDo you think such a feature could improve the UX in such cases?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE - 04/09/2022** - For anyone looking at this issue, there is a workaround to achieve this fallback min duration behaviour in React 17 \ud83c\udf89 , described here: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17351#issuecomment-1236303278\r\n"

If we could somehow have the fallback component receive some kind of state from Suspense on when it is mounting and unmounting the fallback component, that would be great.\r\n"

What I get is the standard production mode minified error.\r\n\r\nFor some reason this time, I can't seem to do *any* of the following:\r\n\r\n1. See any stack information for the component (React just says \"something somewhere is undefined\")\r\n2. Set a breakpoint on the error point (for some reason with webpack + devtool sourcemap, chrome isn't letting me do a mid-line breakpoint at any place above the error)\r\n3. Disable Reacts error catching temporarily so I can pause on the actual error\r\n4. Use a development version of React with any ease but with the prod settings (I tried turning off both process.env.NODE_ENV checks but then you get an error `It is not supported to run the profiling version of a renderer (for example, react-dom/profiling) without also replacing the scheduler/tracing)`\r\n\r\nA big upgrade here would be to fix all of these (except 2, which is either a Webpack or Chrome bug). Can we get better stacks in production mode? That's the ideal. That with number 3 would be the most helpful: a query like `?disableNiceErrors=true` that prevents React from catching/re-throwing the error later would make it so much easier.\r\n\r\nAs it is now, it's incredibly painful to debug (already an hour into it and without the breakpoints working on minified React it's hard to really even figure out where besides manual code commenting).\r\n\r\nEdit: A fifth would be source maps for react itself in production bundles which may work."

For instance, how could I preserve the `.prototype` key of my `props` object without react stripping it? If I wrap my props inside an object, that key can be preserved. But now *all* my props are considered 1 prop to the profiler and I have no visibility on which prop changed.

In current version this is behaviour was replaced be creating new \"bug\" button which will just print all values in console. Unfortunately it's hard to navigate through this object, because $_ in console will return undefined. And in order to access it you need to expand group, find desired property and open context menu->store as global variable. \r\nIt would be perfect if you combine these 2 approaches so it would be possible to both print values using \"bug\" button and opening context menu directly in react dev tools panel wihtout need of intermediate step. \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n"

The core `react` knows about them but you can only create them from other libs (e.g. `ReactDOM`). You have to branch your code because they can\u2019t be server-side rendered. And so on.\r\n\r\nThis is just a pre-RFC to brainstorm ways that Portals can become first-class citizens:\r\n\r\n* Extend `React.createRef()` to allow an optional renderer-specific argument (e.g. the DOM element), matching `useRef()`\r\n* Add `React.createPortal(child, ref)` (*note the use of `ref` rather than a e.g. a direct DOM element*)\r\n* Deprecate `ReactDOM.createPortal()`\r\n\r\nNow with some thought into the structure of your app with modals, they could be e.g. server-side rendered with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App(props) {\r\n  const modal = useRef(null)\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <ModalContext.Provider value={modal}>\r\n        <div>{props.content}</div>\r\n      </ModalContext.Provider>\r\n      <div ref={modal} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Modal(props) {\r\n  const modal = useContext(ModalContext)\r\n  return React.createPortal(\r\n    props.children,\r\n    modal,\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Somewhere in {props.content} tree...\r\nreturn (\r\n  <>\r\n    {visible && (\r\n      <Modal>\r\n        Hello, World!\r\n      </Modal>\r\n    )}\r\n  </>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter `ReactDOM.createPortal(...)` is deprecated, legacy web or those with no need to SSR portals can simply upgrade with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.el = React.createRef(document.createElement('div'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor the same behavior.\r\n\r\nAs an initial version, React can error if `ref.current` is null when it goes to mount the portal. Some sort of dirty flag could be considered separately if proven necessary, but with the pattern proposed above, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary as the portal host would *always* be mounted first as a natural consequence of how React works."

By this I mean that components are aware of the hooks they consume and depend on them explicitly.\r\nThis [issue thread on the recompose repo](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/issues/756) discusses this issue in some detail and how recompose favored keeping components dumb, but wraps them in HOC's to make them smart. Hooks promote baking the smartness right into the component itself.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nReact should offer a way to decouple components from the hooks they consume. I suggest a `withHooks` HOC that maps hooks to props. This will be a familiar model for those who have used redux with react.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst withHooks = mapHooksToProps => WrappedComponent => {\r\n  return props => {\r\n    let hookProps = mapHooksToProps(props);\r\n    return <WrappedComponent {...hookProps} {...props} />;\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Counter = props => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div>Counter: {props.counter}</div>\r\n      <button onClick={props.increment}>Increment</button>\r\n      <button onClick={props.decrement}>Decrement</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapHooksToProps = props => {\r\n  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    counter,\r\n    increment: () => setCounter(prev => prev + 1),\r\n    decrement: () => setCounter(prev => prev - 1)\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst EnhancedCounter = withHooks(mapHooksToProps)(Counter);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/ympq0rlv79\r\n\r\nSome reasons why this is nice:\r\n\r\n1) It decouples components from the things that make them smart. Some examples of things that could make dumb components smart include hooks, redux, and good ol' parent components. By mapping hooks to props, we make it very easy to swap a dumb component's hook-powered 'brain' for a new 'brain', say a redux-powered 'brain'.\r\n\r\n2) Not sure if it's a good idea, but i know several people trying to replace redux with hooks in their applications. For these people, migrations from redux to hooks would be dead simple because they could replace `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` with `mapHooksToProps` and wouldn't have to worry about touching the underlying component.\r\n \r\n3) Testing is also easier because we can test the component in isolation without the hooks baked in.\r\n\r\n4) It makes prop overrides possible. In the case of our EnhancedCounter, we could override the counter prop by doing `<EnhancedCounter counter={10} />`. A real world example of hooks making things harder to override includes material-ui's [new styling approach via hooks](https://material-ui.com/css-in-js/basics/#hook-api). Because classes are provided via hook and no longer via props, we would need custom logic to override classes via props with the new hook-based approach:\r\n```jsx\r\nexport default function Hook(props) {\r\n  let classes = useStyles();\r\n  classes = {...classes, ...props.classes};\r\n  return <Button className={classes.root}>Hook</Button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

For this purpose it's possible to define a `useNext` hook which returns a promise of the next value:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction useNext(value) {\r\n  const valueRef = useRef(value);\r\n  const resolvesRef = useRef([]);\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (valueRef.current !== value) {\r\n      for (const resolve of resolvesRef.current) {\r\n        resolve(value);\r\n      }\r\n      resolvesRef.current = [];\r\n      valueRef.current = value;\r\n    }\r\n  }, [value]);\r\n  return () => new Promise(resolve => {\r\n    resolvesRef.current.push(resolve);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use it like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst nextState = useNext(state);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff(state);\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff(state) {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n  \r\n  // get the new state after the action has taken effect\r\n  state = await nextState();\r\n\r\n  if (!state.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all well and good, but `useNext` has a fundamental limitation: it only resolves promises when the state _changes_... so if dispatching an action resulted in the same state (thus causing `useReducer` to [bail out](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update)), our async function would hang waiting for an update that wasn't coming.\r\n\r\nWhat we _really_ want here is a way to obtain the state after the last dispatch has taken effect, whether or not it resulted in the state changing. Currently I'm not aware of a foolproof way to implement this in userland (happy to be corrected on this point). But it seems like it could be a very useful feature of `useReducer`'s `dispatch` function itself to return a promise of the state resulting from reducing by the action. Then we could rewrite the preceding example as\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff(state);\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff(state) {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n  state = await dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n  \r\n  if (!state.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## EDIT\r\n\r\nThinking about this a little more, the promise returned from `dispatch` doesn't need to carry the next state, because there are other situations where you want to obtain the latest state too and we can already solve that with a simple ref. The narrowly-defined problem is: we need to be able to wait until after a `dispatch()` has taken affect. So `dispatch` could just return a `Promise<void>`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst stateRef = useRef(state);\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  stateRef.current = state;\r\n}, [state]);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff();\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff() {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n\r\n  // can look at current state here too\r\n  if (!stateRef.current.shouldReceiveData) return;\r\n  \r\n  await dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n\r\n  if (!stateRef.current.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```"

But the general idea is that it is often nice to run effect functions even when shallow rendering, rather than having to use full rendering on those specific tests. \r\n\r\nIf the shallow renderer provided an option to run the effect functions, it would allow people who test with shallow rendering to more easily test their components. Enzyme currently supports this in class components by calling componentDidUpdate/mount directly on the component instance, but this would be a much harder thing to do for hooks, since they are usually anonymous.\r\n\r\nEnzyme used to not allow this at all, but then added an option to turn on this behavior in their shallow renderer, before finally turning it on by default and then adding an option to turn it off. It didn't seem to cause too many issues for them, so I think this approach could work well for the React shallow renderer as well. Obviously I'm only asking for an option to turn it on now, not to change the default or anything.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

One is for joining together buttons that are in a row in the interface (Segmented), and the other is for collapsing margins when you have text elements in a vertical column.\r\n\r\nReally this ticket encompasses more of a question or request for documentation clarity here. I'm not sure how it is not pre-concurrent, but I'm assuming mount-order will be non-deterministic if not now then shortly. Is there any reference to a pattern that works for this use case?\r\n\r\nNamely: how children can access their mount order / total children. I can do it now useReducer/context, but I've seen it mount in a weird order at least once and think it was due to a suspense type thing, and would be curious a better practice for this."

Those event listeners are triggering state updates (via `useState`). I think I have found a bug where simultaneous key events occurring in the same frame (whether down or up) will be handled out of order, causing state to becoming out of sync.\r\n\r\nTake the following simple app (https://codesandbox.io/s/1z3v9zrk4j). I've kept this as keyup only for simplicity.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [keys, setKeys] = useState([]);\r\n\r\n  console.log('App', keys);\r\n\r\n  const onKeyUp = function (event) {\r\n    console.log('onKeyUp', event.key, keys);\r\n\r\n    setKeys([...keys, event.key]);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(function () {\r\n    console.log('effect', keys);\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener('keyup', onKeyUp);\r\n\r\n    return function () {\r\n      console.log('removing event listener', keys);\r\n\r\n      window.removeEventListener('keyup', onKeyUp);\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return <p>{keys.join(', ')}</p>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I press down any two keys, e.g. the \"q\" and \"w\" keys, and then release them at precisely the same time, the following happens:\r\n\r\n- The `keyup` event listener for `w` is called, which in turn calls `setKeys` with `['w']`\r\n- `App` is re-rendered with `keys === ['w']`\r\n- The `keyup` event listener for `q` is called, which in turn calls `setKeys` with `['q']`\r\n- The effect's cleanup function is called, removing the event listener with `keys === []`\r\n- The effect is run again, the event listener being added with `keys === ['w']`\r\n- `App` is re-rendered with `keys === ['q']`\r\n- The effect's cleanup function is called, removing the event listener with `keys ===['w']`\r\n- The effect is run again, the event listener being added with `keys === ['q']`\r\n\r\nThis results in `keys === ['q']`. The render with `w` has been lost.\r\n\r\nWith three keys, only two keys are reliably shown. Four keys - only two are reliably shown.\r\n\r\nIf I add another `useState` call, the first `useState` has no issues - all keys are reliably detected. See https://codesandbox.io/s/0yo51n5wv:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const [keys, setKeys] = useState([]); \r\n  const [dummy, setDummy] = useState('foo');\r\n\r\n  console.log(\"rendering App\", keys);\r\n\r\n  const onKeyUp = function(event) {\r\n    console.log(\"onKeyUp event received\", event.key, keys);\r\n\r\n    setKeys([...keys, event.key]);\r\n    setDummy('foo');\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  useEffect(function() {\r\n    console.log(\"adding event listener\", keys);\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(\"keyup\", onKeyUp);\r\n\r\n    return function() {\r\n      console.log(\"removing event listener\", keys);\r\n\r\n      window.removeEventListener(\"keyup\", onKeyUp);\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>Keyups received:</p>\r\n      <p>{keys.join(\", \")}</p>\r\n      <button onClick={() => setKeys([])}>Reset</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect the final state array to contain all keys released, in order. There are a few workarounds for this issue (e.g. passing a function to `setState` to retrieve the current value instead of using the rendered value), but from the documentation it seems that is an escape hatch for use when the effect's callback is not renewed on each state change, and should not be necessary in this case (unless I've misunderstood).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nIt happens on both versions that support hooks - `16.8.0-alpha.0` and `16.8.0-alpha.1`. This is on Chrome/Safari/Firefox on MacOS Mojave.\r\n"

To do this, I detect usage during `render()` by using Proxies, which can register all access. This data, in turn, is used to prevent needless re-renders.\r\n\r\nA parent component can pass a Proxy which represents a string, for example, to a child component, which, without knowing it is a Proxy, can use this value in a calculation (e.g. `props.value + 1` or `` `The value is ${props.value}` ``). This can be handled with `proxy[Symbol.toPrimitive]()`, which is called by JS automatically when used in this sort of expression.\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't work if the child now passes the proxy directly to React as a child:\r\n```jsx\r\n  return (<span>{this.props.childValue</span>);\r\n```\r\nReact will do a `typeof` on the child, find it is an object, and report `Objects are not valid as a React child`. Unfortunately, `typeof` cannot be spoofed with Proxy, and it will always return `'object'`.\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189-L204). The alternative could be for React to check if there's a `child[Symbol.tpPrimitive]` and, if so, evaluate it to find the intended value, and to retry with this value as the child.\r\nIt could be as simple as inserting the following code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b87aabdfe1b7461e7331abb3601d9e6bb27544bc/packages/react/src/ReactChildren.js#L189):\r\n```js\r\n  if (typeof Symbol !== 'undefined') {\r\n    const toPrimitive = children[Symbol.toPrimitive];\r\n    if (toPrimitive) {\r\n      const value = toPrimitive('string');\r\n      if (typeof value !== 'object') {\r\n\t\treturn traverseAllChildrenImpl(\r\n\t\t  value,\r\n\t\t  nameSoFar,\r\n\t\t  callback,\r\n\t\t  traverseContext,\r\n\t\t)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if React would support this use-case. The alternative is for parent components to resolve the value, which would attribute the access to the parent component, instead of the child, where it's really being used. This in turn would cause the parent to be rerendered when only the child is being changed.\r\n\r\nIf the child is aware it may be receiving Proxy objects, it can resolve the value itself. However, the whole point of using Proxies is to automate all the refresh logic (like `shouldComponentUpdate`). Also, not needing to resolve the value would allow the value to propagate through to descendant components which may be wholly unaware of the proxy. \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Similar to `ReactDom.findDomNode`, and (proposed)refs attached to React.Fragment. It just finds all nodes \"you are consists of\". As a result you will be able to `tab` from one `piece` of you to another, making focus management independed of implementation details.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- requires Component to access fiber, DOM node to access fiber thought node, or an new `hook` to do it in a functional way.\r\n- does twice dreadfull things than deprecated `findDomNode`\r\n- usage scope is very narrow.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- _my_ use case requires _momentum_ access to a rendered tree, and does not suffer async stuff as `findDomNode`, where underlaying node might not be yet created. Stuff like \"_does something `containsNode` right now_\", or _\"`getHostNodes` I consist from right now\"_ are sync, and the question asked about actual DOM tree structure.\r\n\r\nExample using [react-dom-reflection](https://github.com/theKashey/react-dom-reflection), which implements required API - https://codesandbox.io/s/1or60v506l\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Once the thrown promise is resolved, React removes the `display: none` style.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe children components have no easy way to know when the `display: none` style is removed by React. This is problematic when one child component needs to read from the DOM layout to correctly display its elements. Most people wait for the `componentDidMount` callback to trigger, but because the element is `display: none`, it can't read any value from the DOM layout.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discovered in https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/14077.

This would enable more advanced hooks to be implementable in user-land.\r\n\r\nI have a use case which is a perfect example. I need a hook similar to `useMemo`, but where the computed value is shared across all components of the same type. I\u2019m calling it `useSharedMemo`.\r\n\r\nThe ideal API would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst Component = ({cacheKey}) => {\r\n  const value1 = useSharedMemo(() => /* expensive computation 1 */, [cacheKey]);\r\n  const value2 = useSharedMemo(() => /* expensive computation 2 */, [cacheKey]);\r\n  return <>{value1} {value2}</>;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the code above, every instance of `Component` would get the same values for `value1` and `value2`, provided `cacheKey` is the same. When `cacheKey` changes, the two values would recompute once and the new values would be returned to all instances as they re-render. (The actual use case in my app is styles that need to update only when the theme changes.)\r\n\r\nI have a [hacky implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/jplyz2pkr9) of this hook that works, but it requires changing the API to the following:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst useSharedMemo = createUseSharedMemo();\r\n\r\nconst Component = ({cacheKey}) => {\r\n  const ref = React.useRef();\r\n  const value1 = useSharedMemo(ref, () => /* expensive computation 1 */, [cacheKey]);\r\n  const value2 = useSharedMemo(ref, () => /* expensive computation 2 */, [cacheKey]);\r\n  return <>{value1} {value2}</>;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this to work, the [implementation](https://codesandbox.io/s/jplyz2pkr9) has to keep a counter of calls that resets every time a component\u2019s render call starts or ends. This would be trivial if there were a way to know which component is currently rendering. Since there is no way, the implementation has to make up for it by requiring a `ref` be passed in. Since it has no information about the type of the current component, it also requires that a `useSharedMemo` \u201cinstance\u201d be created in the component definition\u2019s enclosing scope.\r\n\r\nWorse, the implementation uses `useLayoutEffect` to detect when the render is done, which might break with concurrent mode or with future React changes.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf React provided information about the current rendering component, the implementation of `useSharedMemo` would be much easier and less brittle.\r\n\r\nA possible solution is a hook like the following:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst [currentType, currentRef] = React.useCurrentComponent();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this information, we can implement the ideal API above and we do not have to rely on `useLayoutEffect`:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nlet values = new WeakMap();\r\nlet cacheKeys = new WeakMap();\r\nlet lastRef = null;\r\nlet callIndex = 0;\r\n\r\nfunction useSharedMemo(fn, keys) {\r\n  const [currentType, currentRef] = React.useCurrentComponent();\r\n  if (currentRef !== lastRef) {\r\n    callIndex = 0;\r\n  }\r\n  const index = callIndex;\r\n  callIndex++;\r\n  const typeValues = values.get(currentType) || [];\r\n  const typeCacheKeys = cacheKeys.get(currentType) || [];\r\n  if (!typeValues[index] || !compareKeys(keys, typeCacheKeys[index])) {\r\n    typeValues[index] = fn();\r\n    typeCacheKeys[index] = keys;\r\n    values.set(currentType, typeValues);\r\n    cacheKeys.set(currentType, typeCacheKeys);\r\n  }\r\n  return typeValues[index];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note that I\u2019m treating `currentType` and `currentRef` as opaque values, so for my purposes it doesn\u2019t matter if they are the actual type and an actual ref to the component instance. I imagine having them be accurate would be a more powerful API, but the implementation might require them to be opaque values.)\r\n\r\nP.S. - A common use case that would benefit from `useSharedMemo` is `useCallback`. 99% of the time callbacks are identical across components of the same type. It\u2019s wasteful not to share the cache.\r\n\r\n**Demo**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/jplyz2pkr9\r\n"

However everyone stuck at `2.x` will likely encounter issues with `forwardRef` since that version\r\ndoes not handle any `react@^16.3` features. ^3.2.0 should have no issues apart from some minor\r\nissues with propTypes hoisting from `forwardRef` to `forwardRef`. The latest stable from zeit/next still uses that outdated version. However the latest canary for 7.0.3 does not.\r\n\r\n### react-docgen (400k downloads/week)\r\nNot recognized as a valid component definition. PR open at [reactjs/react-docgen#311].\r\n\r\n### react-redux (1.4M downloads/week)\r\n`connect` does properly forward their refs in the beta release of 6.x. No timeline for stable release given\r\nhowever 3 betas have already been released so it's probably soon.\r\n\r\n### react-router (1.4M downloads/week)\r\n`withRouter` is planned to forward refs ([ReactTraining/react-router#6056#issuecomment-435524678]).\r\nHowever no comment about the other components and no major release candidate is published.\r\n\r\n### display name\r\n`React.forwardRef` components are recognized by `react-devtools`. However when wrapped\r\nin a HOC it's very likely that the display name is lost. See [facebook/react#14319]\r\n\r\n### The issue\r\n**Assumptions:**\r\n- you are not in control of your whole component tree i.e. you use components from 3rd party libraries\r\n- you want to use `React.ConcurrentMode`\r\n- Usable includes production and development. It specifically means for development that deprecation warnings in a component\r\n  make that component not usable in development mode because of all the *noise* it adds in those cases.\r\n  *Noise* because it's not actionable if that component is from a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nIf none of those applies to you then you probably don't have an issue with `findDOMNode` deprecation.\r\n\r\nThe mode of a partial tree can only be made more restrictive but not loosened up. If\r\nyou wrap your tree in `React.StrictMode` and use a component from a 3rd party library\r\nthat 3rd party library has to be `React.StrictMode` compliant too. \r\n\r\nThis means that you can't use `React.StrictMode` effectiveley. This might be ok since it's for development only anyway and has no implications for production. However Concurrent mode can have actual implications for production.  Since it is new and the community wants to use new things libraries have to make sure that they are strict mode compliant too.\r\n\r\nIn addition between the relase of an alternative in the form of `React.forwardRef` and the deprecation only 7 months have passed. One could argue that this is plenty of time but (at least from my perspective) the work on migrating from `findDOMNode` to refs and `forwardRef` was postponed because `findDOMNode` was not deprecated yet.  However the actual deprecation happened one day before the release of `unstable_ConcurrentMode` virtually giving no time to migrate. ~We'll have to see when a stable `16.7` release will happen but assuming this happens today only a month has passed between deprecation and *virtual* removal.~ [React 16.x Roadmap] was release pointing towards Q2 2019 as a release date of stable `React.Concurrent` mode. This relaxes pressure for library maintainers quite a bit IMO.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nRefs are not a viable upgrade path to replace `findDOMNode` yet. \r\nUntil refs are usable without headaches from forwarding refs `findDOMNode` should be undeprecated.\r\n\r\n## Releated\r\n- [forwarding Refs guide on official react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)\r\n- [findDOMNode API documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode) (includes arguments against usage)\r\n- [pull request that deprecated findDOMNode](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841)\r\n\r\n[facebook/react#6436]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436\r\n[facebook/react#13525]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525\r\n[facebook/react#14319]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14319\r\n[reactjs/react-docgen#311]: https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen/pull/311\r\n[ReactTraining/react-router#6056#issuecomment-435524678]: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/6056#issuecomment-435524678\r\n[React 16.x Roadmap]: https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html"

        "description": "# Feature Request\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nuseState/useReducers Hook's updater/dispatch functions do not expose a way to execute code _after_ the update has been made.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nuseState or useReducer Hooks expose some way to locally execute the equivalent of inline useEffect/didUpdate etc. (to allow for overriding default side effect behavior) (e.g. emitEffect(() => ...)).\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\n\r\nFormik exposes 2 props which control when form validation occurs: `validateOnChange` and `validateOnBlur`. When `validateOnChange` set to `true`, form validation will run whenever `handleChange`, `setFieldValue`, or `setValues` are called (these fns all update form `values`). Similarly, when `validateOnBlur` is `true`, validation will also run whenever `handleBlur`, `setFieldTouched`, and `setTouched` are called (these fns all update the `touched` state of the form). The reason that Formik doesn't centralize orchestrating validation logic into `componentDidUpdate` (i.e. run validation whenever either `this.state.values` or `this.state.touched` changes) is to allow for local overrides in custom input components.\r\n\r\nFor example, often times in a 3rd party input component (e.g. like Airbnb's Rheostat (https://github.com/airbnb/rheostat)) the value and touched state need to update together because there isn't a real \"blur\" event for the component or there isn't a prop for it. With Formik, you get around this by updating the field's value and touched state imperatively but override the validation behavior to only run once. To do this, Formik's current non-hooks API exposes an extra parameter to the `setFieldValue` and `setFieldTouched` methods which allow you to opt out of running validation after the update is made. Internally this looks like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsetFieldValue(name, value, shouldValidate = true) {\r\n   this.setState(prevState => setIn(prevState.values, name, value), () => {\r\n      if (this.props.validateOnChange && shouldValidate) {\r\n        this.validateForm(this.state.values)\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\nsetFieldTouched(name, touch = true, shouldValidate = true) {\r\n   this.setState(prevState => setIn(prevState.touched, name, touch), () => {\r\n      if (this.props.validateOnBlur && shouldValidate) {\r\n        this.validateForm(this.state.values)\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a callback was supported by either `useReducer`'s `dispatch` or `useState` update fn, Formik could maintain its current API footprint and allow for the following code to work as expected:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst CustomRangedInput = (props) => {\r\n  const formik = useFormikContext();\r\n  function handleChangeValue(value) {\r\n    // Set the value\r\n    formik.setFieldValue(props.name, value, false /* avoid normal validation logic */)\r\n    // Mark the field as touched\r\n    formik.setFieldTouched(props.name, true)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n   return <Rheostat\r\n     onValueChange={handleChangeValue}\r\n      min={1}\r\n      max={100}\r\n      values={[1, 100]}\r\n   />;\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nHowever, with the current hooks API's there is not a way for me to expose this to users, since I have to lift update the validateOnChange/validateOnBlur validation logic to `useEffect`. In my current Formik x Hooks PR, this looks like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n React.useEffect(\r\n    () => {\r\n      if (!!didMount.current && !!validateOnChange && !state.isSubmitting) {\r\n          validateForm(state.values);\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    [state.values, validateOnChange, state.isSubmitting]\r\n  );\r\n\r\n React.useEffect(\r\n    () => {\r\n      if (!!didMount.current && !!validateOnBlur && !state.isSubmitting) {\r\n          validateForm(state.values);\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    [state.touched, validateOnBlur, state.isSubmitting]\r\n  );\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will execute whenever `state.values` or `state.touched` change, which is usually what people want 98% of the time. However, I don't know/see a way to make this compatible with the old API (where you can locally override validation).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.7.0-alpha\r\n"

A separate static function that converts the return type of `React.Children.map` to the same type as `this.props.children` would also solve the issue.

In fact that's exactly how `react-art` works today.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, nested renderers like `react-art` can't read the context of the outer renderers (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12796). Similarly, we can't time-slice updates in inner renderers because we only update the inner container at the host renderer's commit time.\r\n\r\nAt the time we originally discussed portals we wanted to make them work across renderers. So that you could do something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div>\r\n  <Portal to={ReactART}>\r\n    <surface>\r\n      <rect />\r\n    </surface>\r\n  </Portal>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's not super clear how this should work because renderers can bundle incompatible Fiber implementations.

So far, it was possible to hack around the missing support for it by relying on unstable API (`unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`) to render **and update** a subtree inside a different container. It's important to note that this API was using React's diffing algorithm so that, similar to `ReactDOM.render()`, it is possible to keep components mounted.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container);\r\n// This won't get <Foo /> to be unmounted and mounted again:\r\nReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container);\r\n\r\nReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer(\r\n  parentComponent,\r\n  <Foo />,\r\n  container\r\n);\r\n// This also won't get <Foo /> to be unmounted and mounted again, no matter if \r\n// we change parentComponent (and thus call it from a different parent):\r\nReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer(\r\n  parentComponent,\r\n  <Foo />,\r\n  container\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this unstable API is [going to be deprecated soon](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10143) and recent features like the introduction of the new context API introduced [additional issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12493).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to this unstable API, `ReactDOM.createPortal(children, container)` was introduced. However this API is unsuitable for the reparenting issue since it will always [create a new mount point](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10713) inside the `container` instead of applying the diffing _when called from a different parent_ (Check out this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/91o7oovo54) where calling the portal from a different portal will cause the `<Leaf />` to have a new uuid). The reason for this is that we want multiple portals to be able to render inside the same `container` which makes perfect sense for more common use cases like popovers, etc.\r\n\r\nBefore we're going to remove `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`, I suggest we find a way to portal into a specific node instead of appending to it so that we can diff its contents instead (or implement a solution for #3965 although that seems to be more complicated), similar to `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`."

Take a graphql component.  First it will render a loading spinner, then the data after it has been fetched.  In react-test-renderer, it's difficult to get a snapshot to consistently render for these types of components.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we set an interval timer and check the component tree to see if the data has loaded and thus rendered.  This approach results in a bunch of unnecessary checks and slows down tests because the interval timer will run after the component has been rendered.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect react-test-render to allow a callback that will be invoked each time any component in the component tree changes, basically after any component's `componentDidUpdate` ran.  I would expect an API like:\r\n```\r\nimport TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';\r\nconst testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(\r\n  <Todos />\r\n);\r\ntestRenderer.onChange(() => {\r\n// check TODOS for whether the data has loaded and do the snapshot\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be useful in react-dom and react-native.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This means that Enzyme, in order to support full DOM rendering and it's querying API, it has to interact with React nodes directly. This reliance causes problems in Enzyme whenever React adds a new node type (forwardRef, ContextProvider/Consumer for example).\r\n\r\nI have started [this RFC](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1648) that proposes that Enzyme uses `ReactTestWrapper` from `react-test-renderer` as a layer on top of React node objects. This allows the library to be decoupled from the internals of React. The solution proposed in the RFC relies on the being able to create a `ReactTestInstance` from a `ReactDOM.render` component tree.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is something you would consider \ud83d\ude04 "

For example, in the process of rendering on the server, significant work or additional data may be required for data processing and conversion, such as custom templating or localization. The content can be large too, such as product information or a news article.\r\n \r\nWhen the resulting content is highly dynamic and changes with state, there is no choice but recreate it within React paradigm and recreate it on client.

Add a new callback `shouldComponentHydrate()` to disable hydration of component content\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default class NoHydrate extends Component {\r\n    // return false to avoid re-rendering of this component in hydrate()\r\n    shouldComponentHydrate() {\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        // on server, simply render content\r\n        // on client, this is never called and server content is accepted as-is\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                {this.props.children}\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Access SSR content from DOM in `render()`\r\n_This is probably the worst option, though it is the only one that definitely works currently._\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default class AutoHydrate extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        // on server, simply render content\r\n        // on client, find SSR in dom and re-render using dangerouslySetInnerHTML\r\n        // ** requires a unique id, generated before or during server rendering **\r\n        return (typeof window === 'undefined') ? (\r\n            <div id={this.props.id}>\r\n                {this.props.children}\r\n            </div\r\n        ) : (\r\n            <div id={this.props.id}\r\n                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\r\n                    __html: document.getElementById(this.props.id).innerHTML\r\n                }}\r\n            />\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with empty content\r\n_It actually works now, but it is not documented that it is supposed to._\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default class Ssr extends Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        // on server, simply render content\r\n        // on client, render empty content using dangerouslySetInnerHTML,\r\n        // which normally causes a warning of content mismatch and keeps the existing content\r\n        // also add suppressHydrationWarning to turn off the warning.\r\n        return (typeof window === 'undefined') ?

However, in my haste to start using it, I managed to stumble into a situation where every time I would try and render a certain component which was making use of a few different contexts, the app would completely freeze, and the only thing that would let me get out of this error state was to forcefully kill the process via the chrome task manager.\r\n\r\nNothing would be logged to the console, the app would just completely freeze, and when I opened up the task manager and saw the CPU spiked up every time i would go to this component, and the only way I could stop it was to crash the tab. \r\n\r\nI finally threw some `console` statements in and saw that it had just entered into an infinite loop between these providers. I managed to get the app to stop crashing, but I'm still unsure as to why exactly this was happening. I'm sure I was just using this API incorrectly somehow, but this was a very confusing problem to diagnose, and some error checking here would be incredibly useful\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt would be very beneficial to have some sort of checks in place, similar to what happens with too many `setState` calls happening too closely when you call it from `componentDidUpdate`, for example. That way, instead of freezing everything up permanently, the app could at least crash and report some sort of information and help me realize where I'd gone wrong.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

        "description": "Moved discussion from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6212.\r\n\r\n## Situation\r\n\r\nThe [`focusable` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/interact.html#focusable-attr) from the SVG specifications is an [enumerated attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#keywords-and-enumerated-attributes) accepting values `\"true\"`, `\"false\"` and `\"auto\"`. Because it is technically not a boolean attribute (although it certainly somehow looks like it), React expects the value to be passed as a string. See the following example:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-<svg focusable>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n-<svg focusable={true}>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n+<svg focusable='true'>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is, the `focusable` attribute is often used in conjunction with elements from the ARIA specification, in which attributes are booleans and not enumerated attributes with `\"true\"` and `\"false\"` values. The [`aria-hidden` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-hidden) is a good example of that.\r\n\r\nFor instance, [following a good practice for icon-buttons](https://fvsch.com/code/svg-icons/#section-html):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button type=\"button\">\r\n  <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\r\n    <use xlink:href=\"#icon-play\"></use>\r\n  </svg>\r\n  <span class=\"access-label\">Start playback</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom an authoring perspective, the above snippet would likely be written like this in JSX:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<button type='button'>\r\n  <Icon icon='play' aria-hidden={true} focusable={false} />\r\n  <span class='access-label'>Start playback</span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `focusable` **cannot** be authored as a boolean, otherwise it will **not** be printed out in the DOM. On the other hand, `aria-hidden` is perfectly fine being written as a boolean at it gets coerced by React.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nGiven the default value for the `focusable` attribute is `\"auto\"`, this is very likely this attribute gets authored to change its value to `true` or `false`. In that regard, it is confusing that it has to be specified as a string, when other attributes accepting booleans can be authored as such.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion would be to make it possible for `focusable` to be specified as either a boolean or a string, like other similar attributes. In other words, all the following should work:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<svg focusable>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable={true}>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='true'>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable={false}>I should not be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='false'>I should not be focusable</svg>\r\n<svg focusable='auto'>I should be focusable</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom an authoring perspective, I believe this would be the most straightforward and less confusing."

The component looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass ProseMirror extends Component {\r\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\r\n\t\t// ProseMirror manages the DOM for all nodes below this.el.\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tsetRef(el) {\r\n\t\tthis.el = el;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (<div ref={this.setRef} />);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of its render cycle, our configuration of ProseMirror ends up calling:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nReactDOM.render(<CrucialSubComponent />, someDivManagedByProseMirror);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto render an isolated child node of `<ProseMirror />`, and wants to be able to immediately afterwards be able to leverage:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nthis.el.querySelector('.my-subcomponent')\r\n```\r\n\r\n...but this piece of the DOM is no longer available synchronously, and it looks like this is because of the re-entrancy change that came about in React 16. Portals don't work for us, because the site where the `ReactDOM.render` is being called isn't itself directly part of the root React tree (this is [clearer to observe in the fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/e5hbzc1r/14/)). The hierarchy is something like `<ProseMirror /> ---> (opaque ProseMirror rendering code) --> <CrucialSubComponent />`. Is there a way to skip these re-entrancy checks in these cases where there's an isolated React render happening in a grandchild of a component, but where the React tree isn't the immediate parent?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

        "description": "This is an incomplete draft for a feature I think could be\r\nreally cool. It can replace higher order components\r\nand context in a way I think is more in the component\r\nspirit of React.\r\n\r\nI do not know if this feature is feasible or desirable for\r\nReact, especially as it would lead to a bigger API surface.\r\nThe proposal is written as if it was documentation to\r\ngive a feel for how it would be to use it.\r\n\r\n# About React middleware\r\nA middleware is applied somewhere in the component tree\r\nand are instantiated just after child components are\r\ninstantiated and just before they mount. In this context,\r\nchild components means child components at any depth.\r\n\r\nMiddleware is used just like normal components, but\r\nit works slightly differently. When a middleware element\r\nis used it added to the middleware stack. If it is\r\nalready on the middleware stack, it removed from\r\nthe stack and pushed to the end, with the most\r\ninnermost props.\r\n\r\n## Simplified example\r\nIn addition to the actual classes, the stack also\r\nincludes its most recent props. But this is roughly\r\nhow it works.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<MiddlewareA>\r\n  {/* middleware stack for \"A\": [MiddlewareA] */}\r\n  <A />\r\n  <MiddlewareB>\r\n    {/* middleware stack for \"B\": [MiddlewareA, MiddlewareB] */}\r\n    <B>\r\n      <MiddlewareA\r\n        {/* middleware stack for \"C\": [MiddlewareB, MiddlewareA] */}\r\n        <C />\r\n      </MiddlewareA>\r\n    </B>\r\n  </MiddlewareB>\r\n</MiddlewareB>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Lifecycle methods\r\n\r\n## Additions to the existing lifecycle methods\r\n\r\n### Mounting\r\n- new: Middleware.shouldMiddlewareMount\r\n- new: Middleware.shouldMiddlewarePropagate\r\n- Component#constructor\r\n- new: Middleware#constructor\r\n- new: Middleware#middlewareWillMount()\r\n- Component#componentWillMount()\r\n- Component#render()\r\n- new: Middleware#interceptRender()\r\n- Component#componentDidMount\r\n\r\n### Unmounting\r\n- new: Middleware#middlewareWillUnmount\r\n\r\n## static shouldMiddlewareMount(ReactComponent)\r\nDetermine if the current middleware should apply for\r\na component. If the method isn't implemented, the\r\nmiddleware will always be applied.\r\n\r\nIf a middleware is on the middleware stack, this method\r\nis called every time a component is constructed.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass TransformInlineStyles extends React.Middleware {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Only mount middleware when you set\r\n   * transformInlineStyles to a truthy\r\n   * value. Children of the given\r\n   * component can still enable\r\n   * the middleware\r\n   */\r\n  static shouldMiddlewareMount(Component) {\r\n    return Component.transformInlineStyles\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst A = props => (\r\n  // ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst B = props => (\r\n  // ...\r\n)\r\nB.transformInlineStyles = true\r\n\r\nconst App = () => (\r\n  <TransformInlineStyles>\r\n    {/* Not applied to \"A\" */}\r\n    <A>\r\n      {/* Applied to \"B\" */}\r\n      <B />\r\n    </A>\r\n  </TransformInlineStyles>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## static shouldMiddlewarePropagate(ReactComponent)\r\nDetermine whether the middleware should remain on\r\nthe middleware stack or be excluded for the subtree\r\nbelow the given component. If not specified it returns\r\nfalse, in other words: The default behavior for\r\nmiddleware is to propagate.\r\n\r\nThis is useful if you want to limit middleware from\r\naffecting deeply nested children. It is also useful\r\nfor only giving middleware access to its immediate\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\n\r\nclass ProvideTheme extends React.Middleware {\r\n  static StopPropagation = props => props.children\r\n\r\n  static shouldMiddlewarePropagate(Component) {\r\n    return Component !== this.StopPropagation\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst App = () => (\r\n  <ProvideTheme>\r\n    {/* middleware stack for \"A\": [ProvideTheme] */}\r\n    <A>\r\n      <ProvideTheme.StopPropagation>\r\n        {/* middleware stack for \"B\": [] */}\r\n        <B />\r\n      </ProvideTheme.StopPropagation>\r\n      {/* middleware stack for \"C\": [ProvideTheme] */}\r\n      <C />\r\n    </A>\r\n  </ProvideTheme>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## middlewareWillMount(reactInstance)\r\nCalled before the child component calls componentWillMount.\r\nThis is a good place to initialize state for the middleware\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n## MiddlewareWillUnmount(reactInstance)\r\nCalled before the child component calls componentWillUnmount.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nThis is a na\u00efve example of how it could be used to trigger\r\nautomatic updates with Mobx.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Observer extends React.Middleware {\r\n  middlewareWillMount(reactInstance) {\r\n    this.dispose = autorun(() => {\r\n\r\n      // Let Mobx track the observables\r\n      // used in the render method.\r\n      reactInstance.render()\r\n\r\n      // Force update the component instance\r\n      // after Mobx has stopped tracking the\r\n      // autorun function.\r\n      //\r\n      // .. yes, I know it's hacky.\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        reactInstance.forceUpdate()\r\n      })\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  middlewareWillUnmount(reactInstance) {\r\n    // Stop listening for changes from Mobx\r\n    this.dispose()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## interceptRender(children)\r\ninterceptRender is called with the result from the render\r\nfunction of the component. The resulting value is what is\r\nused to render the DOM.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nThis is an example of a middleware that transforms object\r\nclasses into a string. The result works similarly to how\r\nng-class works in AngularJS.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass ObjectClassNames extends React.Middleware {\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * This is a life cycle method.\r\n   *\r\n   * Intercept the render method and recursively\r\n   * loop through all children, performing\r\n   * this.transformProps() on their props.\r\n   */\r\n  interceptRender(children) {\r\n    return React.Children.map(children, child => {\r\n      if (! React.isValidElement(child)) {\r\n        return child\r\n      }\r\n      return {\r\n        ...child,\r\n        props: this.transformProps(child.props),\r\n        children: this.interceptRender(child.children)\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * If a child has an object className, call\r\n   * this.transformClassname() on it.\r\n   */\r\n  transformProps(props) {\r\n    if (! props || ! props.className || typeof props.className !== 'object') {\r\n      return props\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      ...props,\r\n      className: this.transformClassname(props.className)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Concatenate the truthy keys of the className\r\n   * object into a string.\r\n   */\r\n  transformClassname(className) {\r\n    const result = []\r\n\r\n    for (const key of Object.keys(className)) {\r\n      if (className[key]) {\r\n        result.push(key)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return result.join(' ')\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Widget = (props) => (\r\n  <div className={{ 'Widget': true, 'Widget--active': props.active }}>\r\n    Some widget\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst App = () => (\r\n  <ObjectClassNames>\r\n    <Widget active={true} />\r\n  </ObjectClassNames>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Why middleware?\r\nReact middleware can replace two problematic patterns used with React.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThe h2 on context in the React docs says \"Why Not To Use\r\nContext\". Context is however a very useful feature. And\r\npeople have been and will continue to use and abuse it\r\nin the forseeable future. React Router has started\r\nabusing context in its most recent version, which shows\r\nthat there is clearly a need here.\r\n\r\nWith middleware, as I propose it, you would be able to\r\ninject props into an arbitrary subtree of your app. This\r\nhas performance implications, but would be an ideal\r\nscenario for libraries such as React Router, as the\r\nrelevant props (or as it is now, context) rarely\r\nchanges. With middleware shouldComponentUpdate\r\nwill still function like you would expect.\r\n\r\n## Higher order components\r\nA primal rule of programming is DRY. When using Mobx\r\nwith React, you must use the observer decorator on\r\nall reactive classes. This isn't a really big deal,\r\nbut not having to include that would reduce the size\r\nof every single observer component by two lines and\r\nmost importantly, I wouldn't forget it.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a higher order component static properties\r\nare no longer available. The package hoist-non-react-static\r\nis designed so that you should be able to access static\r\nproperties of higher order components transparently.\r\nIf a static property is initialized in the lifecycle\r\nmethods of a component, it will however not be proxied.\r\n\r\nCreating higher order components is also a messy affair.\r\n\r\nWith middleware you could achive the same thing in a React\r\nway. To replace connect from react-redux you could set\r\nshouldMiddlewarePropagate to return false, and it would\r\naffect only one component.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could use static properties for\r\nmapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps."

As the profiler would have control over when the toggling happens, I think it would be fine to throw an error/return false/something like that if the logging was toggled while inside a React stack, allowing the profiler to try again later.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if the toggling was synchronous the profiler cp avoid this error by doing the toggling at the start and end of an event handler/setTimeout/reqAnimFrame etc which would ensure that we are not inside synchronous call into React (though I'm not quite sure what the implications of Fiber are here; would React async rendering mean that we could re-enter from the event loop at a time when this toggling should not happen?). \r\n\r\nAlternatively the toggling could happen 'async but just later in the same React stack' (like setState). In this case the code requesting the toggling would probably need some kind of callback to know that toggling happened so it can keep track of whether React's logging is on or off. However this variant seems like it would be more complicated to implement, and for our use case I don't think it's any more useful than having the toggling just fail in a recoverable way.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon "

        "description": "This is a feature request. It relates to https://discuss.reactjs.org/t/suggestion-for-global-context/9035\r\n\r\nThis has been a pain point for me, and I'm sure we can do better. The issue: How to have some state available to all components without passing everything down on props through the component tree.\r\n\r\nI'm speaking about global state. So why not use context? I have a couple of issue with it.\r\n\r\n1. It's not the root component's job to receive and disseminate state. The root component is just some component. It shouldn't care if it's root or not. Maybe you have (example using Express):\r\n\r\n    `res.render('homepage.jsx', {});`\r\n\r\nBut some other page might just as well have:\r\n\r\n    res.render('otherpage.jsx', {}) where otherpage has:\r\n\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Something />\r\n      <Homepage />\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\nComponents can be composed however you like, they shouldn't care what depth they're at.\r\n\r\n2. Above is talking about a multipage app. The thinking around React seems to be so skewed toward to the special case of Single Page App. SPA is sometimes the right choice. If you're Google Maps it's clearly right. If you're something broader in scope like Amazon.com it's clearly not. The general case is much more interesting to solve.\r\n\r\n3. Having every root component wrapped in some `<Provider>` that publishes context downwards, and every non-root component wrapped in some \"receiver\" higher level component that declares context is just boilerplate. It's not expressive, it's bookkeeping.\r\n\r\n4. Alternatives: There aren't any as far as I know. Each component only knows about the props (and possibly context) passed in, it doesn't have any handle on data for the current render() call. Simply importing global state through CommonJS or ES6 modules is impossible on the serverside for anything request scoped (like query params, route params, cookies, headers, anything generated by middleware based on these things).\r\n\r\n-- PROPOSAL --\r\n\r\nWhy not just handle global state at a higher level than props passed component to component? Why not extend ReactDOM.render to take a 4th argument for global context? It would just make everyone's life easier. Don't even worry about changes firing componentWillReceiveProps, at least as a first version.\r\n\r\nThink of it as analogous to Express and the \"req\" object that's passed around. One should always have access to some \"per request\" object. So many things would be useful to put in there (authenticated user, geolocation, \"store\" from Redux, query and route params, etc, etc).\r\n\r\nIt would look like:\r\n\r\n    ReactDOM.render(rootComponent, someDiv, callback, {... request specific data ...})\r\n\r\nWhere request specific data might have things that are truly request specific and also things that are the same across requests. The latter can be done with imports but it's a bit messy -- you end up with code like:\r\n\r\n    if (typeof window != 'undefined') {\r\n      // Client, get value from window object\r\n    } else {\r\n      // Server, get value from filesystem or wherever\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJust having global data available to all components in the tree simplifies things a lot. Don't you think?\r\n"

Currently the only way to do this would be to externally maintain a renderer implementation. However, the `ReactPartialRenderer` already contains all the behavior required to support plugins - with a little refactoring. \r\n\r\nI've refactored the `ReactPartialRenderer` and created a **proof of concept** for supporting _plugins_ for react server side rendering. You can see the [ReactPartialPluginRenderer](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commits/pluginRenderer) in this fork, its comprised of 3 different commits:\r\n* [#1](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/0b2f7852a19ffabac6b83581f6821f0346434ef0): Strict refactoring of `ReactPartialRenderer`, the only addition is exporting the `ReactPartialRenderer` from the react-dom server package\r\n* [#2](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/d30792a8ba42d50188c0dd1fddbc73275b8ff91f): Create the `ReactPartialPluginRenderer` by extending the refactored `ReactPluginRenderer`, and introduce a plugin interface\r\n* [#3](https://github.com/adam-26/react/commit/d4f01973d535c9eb34ba450190b7c8205fe593df): Proof of concept plugin implementations and application example.\r\n\r\nYou can [view instructions for running the example in the repo](https://github.com/adam-26/react/tree/pluginRenderer/fixtures/ssrPlugins).\r\n\r\nI understand that exporting `ReactPartialRenderer` exposes the internal API, which is far from ideal. Is there any scenario in which `ReactPartialRenderer` would be made to be accessible from the `react-dom` package? Or would a plugin implementation similar to above be required to maintain its own forked `ReactPartialRenderer`? Maintaining the plugin renderer in its own repo isn't a problem, but It would be great if plugins could be used without needing to maintain the core server renderer.\r\n\r\nThanks, Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However I do miss the perf tool from previous versions and could not find any issue tracking a re-implementation of such a tool.\r\n\r\nWhat was great in the perf tool that is not covered as well with timeline integration?\r\n - Easily see which components render needlessly and therefore should be easily eliminated with sCU (and what impact it will give)\r\n - Easily see the collective render time of a component. I might for example have a component that renders very fast but which have very many instances and thus contribute to a significant render time anyway.\r\n - Give an overview of which components are slow by themselves and which are fast by themselves but render slow components. The flamegraph shows this, but I find it to specific in some scenarios with too much detail that can distract.\r\n\r\nBasically the wasted, exclusive and inclusive tables. The DOM table I feel is much better represented by the timeline integration.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Actually it does not preform binding at all). What is the reason of binding function in event handler? - we need to access current component props or current component state. Is there another way to get props or state of component? React does not describe this in docs but yes - we can access to props or state of current component without any unnecessary functions recreations on each render.\r\n```\r\nfunction Node({node}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <button onClick={onClick}>remove</button>\r\n      <div>{node.text}</div>\r\n   </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction onClick(e){\r\n  const {node} = getProps(e);\r\n  node.parent.removeChild(node)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getProps(e){\r\n  return e.target[Object.keys(e.target).filter(k => k.indexOf('__reactInternalInstance') !== -1)[0]]._debugOwner.memoizedProps;\r\n} \r\n```\r\nand this demo https://codesandbox.io/s/4r59w89lox\r\n\r\nTo perform event delegations in an efficient way react need to assign current vdom-element to each rendered dom element. And vdom-element has link to actual owner component where we can get our props and state. So why react concealed this from developers and made them suffer not only from performance degradation but also from choosing problem (how many articles and advices recommend or investigate this rule to not bind handlers in render function, and how many solutions exist - use bind in constructor ? - use class field properties with arrow functions ? - use autobind decorators?) ??? And my solution not need even to recreate handlers on each component instantiation like all current solutions does, so it definitely the fastest way. I highly suggest make this api public or make some helper to get current props and state from event.target"

And when it does, it includes other [spec'd properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputEvent) which can be extremely helpful:\r\n\r\n- `inputType` tells you whether the event is inserting text, replacing text, inserting a line break, etc.\r\n- `getTargetRanges()` tells you where the input is taking place in the DOM.\r\n\r\nRight now this information isn't exposed, because even if the browser supports `beforeinput`, it's not being checked for.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nInstead React should treat `textInput` as a slightly-preferred fallback for native `beforeinput` support, but add `beforeinput` as the true goal. So we'd end up with a fallback stack of:\r\n\r\n- `beforeinput`\r\n- `textInput`\r\n- `keypress`\r\n\r\nWhich guarantees that the `nativeEvent` will always be the most spec'd and have the most relevant information associated with it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `beforeinput` event's extra properties are critical in `contenteditable` situations, when you want to prevent the default browser behavior from firing but perform the logic on an internal model instead. (I'm looking to do this for [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate).) \r\n\r\nWithout that extra information you have to fallback to hackier behavior\u2014allowing the event to occur, trying to parse the DOM for what the change was, then re-rendering to remove it, etc. I want to avoid this on the more modern browsers, because it results in reduced performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is another situation that this fixes, which is that spellcheck right now doesn't trigger React's `onBeforeInput` handler, even though modern browsers fire the `beforeinput` event, because it's not being listened for right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then you click on a link and press the back button. The browser back-forward cache (or maybe the form restauration logic) will kick in and change the initial value of the form elements. You will get the `foo` value back in the input. However, React doesn't account for it when the component is controlled.\r\n\r\nFor end-users, it means that they will try to submit a form because they see values in the inputs, but it won't work. They need to go back to each field and make a \"fake\" change so that React registers it.\r\n\r\nThis issue could also be worked around by not controlling the inputs, but I'm not sure how popular form libraries handle this.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect React to trigger an `onChange` event to replicate the actual form value. \r\nAt the fundamental level, there is a coordination issue between the browser and React.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- React `@latest` (v18.2.0).\r\n- Chrome `@latest` (v112.0)\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nWe have been using the following hack on Material UI:\r\n```js\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    // Fix SSR issue with the go back feature of the browsers.\r\n    // Let's say you start filling the input with \"foo\", you change the page then after comes back.\r\n    // The browser will reset the input value to \"foo\", but we also need to tell React about it.\r\n    this.handleChange({\r\n      target: this.input,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it comes with issues: https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/8110.\r\nSo instead, we tried simulating a change event [as suggested in Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23892547/what-is-the-best-way-to-trigger-onchange-event-in-react-js) but it doesn't work anymore\r\n```js\r\nvar event = new Event('input', { bubbles: true });\r\nelement.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for now, we are going to disable the cache with `<form autoComplete=\"off\">`.\r\n"

        "description": "So for the last little while I've been pursuing an idea called [React Snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot), where instead of running your code in a Node environment to generate static HTML, you run it in a virtual browser (jsdom or chrome headless) and take a snapshot of the DOM at a particularly moment in time, then host the snapshots like any other static file (technique also known as pre-rendering).\r\n\r\nI've been tossing around different API choices (https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot/pull/30) in order to handle components that have async data fetching requirements, but I'm already starting to see real promise in this approach. Because the snapshot environment is so similar to the client one, far fewer changes are needed to get the performance & accessibility benefits of serving real HTML to your users. This is an example of the React Snapshot async API to make a component snapshottable:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n+ import { snapshot } from 'react-snapshot'\r\n\r\nclass Home extends React.Component {\r\n  state = { quotes: null }\r\n\r\n  componentWillMount() {\r\n+   snapshot(() => (\r\n      fetch('/api/quotes')\r\n        .then(response => response.json())\r\n+   ))\r\n    .then(quotes => {\r\n      this.setState({ quotes })\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { quotes } = this.state\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"Quotes\">\r\n        {\r\n          quotes && quotes.map((quote, i) => <Quote key={i} quote={quote}/>)\r\n        }\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is that any async parts of your app can be wrapped in a `snapshot` call, which caches responses and rehydrates on the client. However, I've hit a few walls that I think means I'd need changes to React itself to take this to its logical conclusion. Hence, I wanted to start the discussion about whether such changes would be compatible with React's future direction.\r\n\r\n### Rehydration\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell from my experimentation and from reading the code, the two criteria for reusing the existing DOM elements in a pre-rendered HTML page is:\r\n\r\n* the adler32 hash of the initial client-rendered markup has to match the `data-react-checksum` present on the `rootElement`.\r\n* the `_domID` of each instance in the render tree needs to match the `data-react-id` on each DOM element\r\n\r\nBetween those two criteria, its enforced that the _structure_ and the _content_ of the DOM is the same. I can kinda see why both are needed\u2014the checksum is the cheapest way to confirm the structure will be the same, but the ID of each element is needed to actually wire everything up. Also, `data-react-checksum` is just an attribute, and could be calculated off something that's no longer present in the HTML.\r\n\r\nHowever, generating the exact right checksum in any other way than the existing SSR API turns out to be pretty difficult!\r\n\r\n### HTML-escaping woes\r\n\r\nI hit this problem where I was rendering the React app like normal, then taking the `innerHTML` of the root container, then passing it to [`addChecksumToMarkup`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/stack/server/ReactMarkupChecksum.js#L26), and not getting the same checksum as `ReactDOMServer.renderToString`. I first realised I needed to add the `data-reactid` to each element along the way, which wasn't too hard, but still it wasn't working. I figured out it's due to [`escapeTextContentForBrowser`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/shared/escapeTextContentForBrowser.js) converting things like `'` to `&#x27;` and `\"` to `&quot;`, meaning that while the content _appears_ the same once rendered, the precise string is not, therefore the checksum is not, and no rehydration takes place.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can understand, again by reading the code, React _always_ sanitises the HTML content before generating markup (on server or in client), it's just the fact that once its injected into the DOM, `innerHTML` doesn't re-sanitise things like quotes. They don't technically need to be, as discussed in issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3879, and so if that were to be changed this particular problem would disappear, but there may well be more I just haven't hit yet. To me, the real issue is needing to have the content be byte-for-byte equivalent, rather than just functionally (and structurally) equivalent.\r\n\r\n### My interim solution\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've realised its easier to boot up the app in its entirety, wait for all async processes to take place, then effectively reboot the app using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` and splice the markup in place. Any side-effects relying on `componentDidMount` (like CSS injection or meta tags in the HEAD) that affect the DOM _outside_ the React app are preserved, but the markup and checksum of the React-rendered HTML are guaranteed to be correct. It works, but its not ideal. You still have to understand that your components are running in two different \"modes\", they'll run different lifecycle methods in each, and only one generates the final snapshot. Which I think adds an unreasonable conceptual burden, much the same way server-rendering does.\r\n\r\nThat's really the problem I see with the status quo and why I started looking into this problem in the first place. If snapshot/server rendering requires too much overhead, most people won't do it, which is exactly where we're at. Create-react-app doesn't include any because none of the options are simple enough with a broad enough applicability. The official [React Router docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/code-splitting/code-splitting-server-rendering) warn agains combining server-rendering and code-splitting. Server-rendering boilerplates include fairly specific webpack hacks to provide the same environment on server and client, etc.\r\n\r\nThe result is that most people only ever do client-rendering. They serve a blank page & render everything client-side. Code splitting and service worker caching offer useful advantages but imo it's not enough. Snapshot rendering _could_ be the solution, but only if it can offer big benefits for small changes to application code.\r\n\r\n### My Dream Solution\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, what I'd like is for an arbitrary React app to be launched on one browser, executed until ready (async resources complete), snapshotted (serialised to HTML), then resumed on another browser. Those snapshots would be generated then cached at the edge of a CDN during deployment, or periodically depending on how often the content changes.\r\n\r\nPractically, I think that would require two changes to React's architecture:\r\n\r\nThe first is for a weaker check for rehydration\u2014some other fingerprint than a hash of the escaped HTML. Some other method for a snapshot to indicate to React to reuse as much of the existing DOM as possible.\r\n\r\nThe second would be for only parts of the tree to be rehydrated rather than the whole thing. If a component has some side-effect, say in a `componentDidMount`, then the snapshotted HTML would include the result of that side-effect. But when the app boots on the client side, the render method will generate the initial behaviour. At the moment React would replace what's there with what's just been rendered, but it might be preferable to leave the DOM unchanged on the first render, then wire things up later.\r\n\r\nI don't know the exact specifics of a solution, nor do I know enough of the internals of React as it is now or as it will become, but I wanted to start the discussion and see if there was any interest from the React team & wider community in this use case and direction. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!"

Ideally it should instead queue up all the differences and then at the end (commit) issue a single warning with a nicely formatted diff.\r\n\r\n1) Instead of warning add [these warn calls](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8d61138186e79e1e719786c8c76186e64b603bd5/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberComponent.js#L74-L115) to a global buffer (array, map, set, whatever).\r\n\r\n2) Inside [prepareForCommit](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8d61138186e79e1e719786c8c76186e64b603bd5/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberEntry.js#L190), issue all the currently batched up warnings as a single message. \r\n\r\n3) Format that message in terms of a JSX diff in a nicely formatted way. With only the relevant nodes (parent and child with changes). Irrelevant child content can be replaced with ellipsis. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n<div className=\"unchanged\">\r\n- <div className=\"foo\" />\r\n+ <div className=\"bar\">\u2026</div>\r\n+ <span />\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n<div className=\"another_unchanged\">\r\n- <span />\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis strategy won't yield perfect results because if we're asynchronously hydrating, and it gets interrupted by another tree, we'll flush a warning before the actual hydrating particular tree is flushed. So we might show a partial diff in that case. This is probably. It's just a warning."

However, in an app that consumes this component library package, a dev may want to create a `<SpecialProductButton />` that in turn renders a `<Button>` - however, they're unable to pass it into `ButtonRow` (our propType warnings fail tests), even though conceptually it should be permitted.\r\n\r\nHaving `.renderTypes` would allow us to widen our `children` propType to allow for either a `<Button>`, or *anything that renders a `<Button>`*, which helps us maintain separation of concerns (the package doesn't have to know about `<SpecialProductButton>` to accept it) as well as maintain strictness (the package doesn't have to allow any wacky element inside `<ButtonRow>`).\r\n\r\nI imagine the implementation to be:\r\n 1. when render() is called or an SFC is invoked, (in async rendering, it'd be when the component resolves, i suppose)\r\n 1. in development only and if `.renderTypes` exists on the component\r\n 1. evaluate the equivalent of [`elementType`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airbnb-prop-types)`(...Component.renderTypes)({ children: renderedValue }, 'children', ...)`,\r\n 1. just like propTypes, log the error if one is returned\r\n\r\n(cc @spicyj)"

The predicate function is passed the public instance for the node.\r\n\r\nThe issue with that is that it makes the predicate function polymorphic and requires every consuming utility to check if it's being passed a component instance or a DOM node. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nI propose that we implement a new API similar to `findAllInRendererdTree` that calls the predicate function with the result of calling `toTree` on the internal instance instead of the public instance. This would mean:\r\n\r\n* the predicate function will always be called with the same data structure (a tree node)\r\n* third-party traversal utilities can be shared between `ReactTestRenderer` and `ReactTestUtils`, since they would operate on the same tree structure\r\n* You could actually assert on functional components, which currently have no instance and just call the predicate with `null`\r\n\r\nThis new API could just be a pure traversal utility, leaving it up to the consumer to accumulate results.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { renderIntoDocument, traverseTree } from 'react-dom/test-utils';\r\nvar root = renderIntoDocument(<App />);\r\nvar results = [];\r\ntraverseTree(root, node => {\r\n  if (somePredicate(node) { results.push(node) }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n \r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nWith a brief review, it looks like we could just export the `toTree` function that is currently inlined in `ReactTestRenderer` and provide a way to change:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n var publicInst = node.stateNode;\r\n      if (test(publicInst)) {\r\n        ret.push(publicInst);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n```js\r\n var treeNode = toTree(node);\r\n      if (test(treeNode)) {\r\n        ret.push(treeNode);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon @bvaughn @lelandrichardson "

There has been some pushback though to the idea of React modifying the DOM for warning purposes (see issue #8784). I'm not sure how that will play out yet- but in the meanwhile, could we improve at least some of these use cases by making better use of the devtools?\r\n\r\nFor example, what if React exposed a new API that allowed associating a warning with one or more components in the devtools panel? (eg a method that- when called- recorded the current component stack and notified devtools if present) React could use this for things like missing or non-unique keys. 3rd party libraries may also benefit from this (eg react-virtualized could use this to warn about missing or incomplete positioning styles for cells).\r\n\r\nHere's a rough outline of some of the features:\r\n* Components with warnings could be highlighted in some emphasized way (eg yellow background) in devtools to make them easier to spot.\r\n* A new toolbar option could be added to \"Show All Warnings\" (eg filter the tree view to show only components with warnings).\r\n* Warning message could be shown inline in the settings panel for the selected component.\r\n\r\nHere's a rough mockup: \r\n![screen shot 2017-03-15 at 3 47 31 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/29597/23974108/bc3dabd6-0996-11e7-8d2a-e058c4cafe41.png)\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n* Not everyone uses devtools so this would not help a lot of people.\r\n* This would not address issues like using the development mode of React for production sites.\r\n\r\nThoughts?

Paragraphs, headings, that kind of stuff. However, there are also active components with JS interaction bindings, and so I was trying to figure out a way to turn this article into a \"react-managed by the client\" into a \"thin ui managed by the client, react-built offline\" solution. \r\n\r\nI had a look at ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup, but while this generates all the HTML nicely, it also loses any and all JS bindings that are necessary to keep the UI working. As this is an ~800kb article not counting static assets (there's some 1.6MB of images on top of that), the notion of first loading the plain markup content and then loading the react bundle on top of that, to hook into the preloaded markup would be a terrible experience for people in the slightly-less-wealthy parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIs there some way to, or would there be a sense in developing a way to render React content to HTML \"as much as possible\" while preserving React's management of interactive UI components? Essentially, a solution in between `renderToString` and `renderToStaticMarkup`, to prevent as much data duplication between the pregenerated HTML and the react application itself? It seems that the heavy payload (in bytes, but certainly in client-side processing as well) incurred by using a fully react-managed bundle could be relieved significantly if \"content that is guaranteed passive, regular HTML\" could be serialized out as HTML with React hooking back into that code only for elements that require active management.\r\n\r\n(I have no idea how much work that would be, but I'm pretty sure it would help bring down the average page size down again, which on a global scale would save quite a lot of time and money, while allowing content to be loaded by people for whom parts of the internet are currently inaccessible due to load time and byte cost)"

This is great, and we use it to collect component level performance metrics for our customers in production, however, there are more things we'd love to have access to for the purpose of helping our users pinpoint performance issues in their applications.\r\n\r\nThis \"issue\" includes some initial observations, but I hope we can keep an open dialogue about this - in particular considering Fiber will probably change the landscape with regards to what the most common performance problems are and we'd instrument according to that.\r\n\r\nI understand the urge to keep the API surface area as small as possible in order to create minimal commitment to APIs to allow for internals to move fast. Exposing additional internals with the explicit warning that you are not committed to their API is fine for us, as a tool vendor.\r\n\r\nWe've looked at using `batchedUpdates` to highlight the batched nature of the work performed by React. E.g. is the work in your application getting batched properly. If we only have access to the component updating methods on `ReactReconciler` (`mountComponent`, `receiveComponent`, `unmountComponent` etc) we can't really know when a batch of work starts and when it ends. `batchedUpdates` is available in ReactDOM with the `unstable_` prefix, but exposing it in the `inject` hook would be very useful: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/ReactDOM.js#L38\r\n\r\nWe've also (experimentally) hooked into `EventPluginUtils.executeDispatchesInOrder` in order to capture events and measure the work resulting from these, but i suspect there is a better place to do this (`ReactEventListener.dispatchEvent`?). In any case, having access to the event system would be very useful. Again, using the \"unstable_\" prefix to indicate non-committal would be fine for us.\r\n\r\nI've not had much time to look into what we'd need access to for Fiber instrumentation, but so far it looks like a hook into `beginWork` would be very useful: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/199db638c4d0fbc6e4d99534be0060deea518a32/src/renderers/shared/fiber/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L640"

We could change the implementation so that when React detects a custom element (tag names with dashes, like `my-component`), it will bypass the synthetic event system (and the whitelist) and just attach the event listener on the element itself.\n\nWhy bypass the synthetic event system? Because _anyway_ we already need to bypass it manually when using a Web Component. I'm not so familiar with the React codebase, but this naive approach seems to work. Whoever uses Web Components in React can be responsible for whatever downsides that would cause, maybe in performance, I don't know. They are already having those (supposed) downsides, this issue is just about the convenience of WC usage inside React.\n\nI was about to send a PR for this, but thought of opening an issue. I looked through the issues and didn't see any existing one related to the handling of WC events.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\nA WC custom event (e.g. `flipend`) must be handled by attaching the event listener directly to the element in componentDidMount using a ref.\n\nhttp://jsbin.com/yutocopasu/1/edit?js,output\n\nReact v15.1.0\n\n``` js\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\n  handleHelloClick() {\n    this.refs['foo'].toggle();\n  }\n\n  handleFlipend(ev) {\n    console.log('Handle flip end');\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.refs['foo'].addEventListener('flipend', ev =>\n      this.handleFlipend(ev);\n    );\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div onClick={ev => this.handleHelloClick()}>\n          Hello {this.props.name}, click me!\n        </div>\n        <brick-flipbox class=\"demo\" ref=\"foo\">\n          <div>front</div>\n          <div>back</div>\n        </brick-flipbox>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nA WC custom event can be handled with `onMyEvent={ev => this.handleMyEvent(ev)}` on the ReactElement corresponding to the WC.\n\n``` js\nclass HelloMessage extends React.Component {\n  handleHelloClick() {\n    this.refs['foo'].toggle();\n  }\n\n  handleFlipend(ev) {\n    console.log('Handle flip end');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div onClick={ev => this.handleHelloClick()}>\n          Hello {this.props.name}, click me!\n        </div>\n        <brick-flipbox onFlipend={ev => this.handleFlipend(ev)} class=\"demo\" ref=\"foo\">\n          <div>front</div>\n          <div>back</div>\n        </brick-flipbox>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPS: this snippet above still has the `ref`, but for unrelated reasons.

        "description": "_Just going to put it out there for feedback..._\n## Motivation\n\nSubscription management comes with a cost and that eats into the wins of async rendering since it needs to be managed synchronously. Not just managing the direct subscriptions themselves but managing the dynamic dependency graph so that it can be invalidated.\n\nMeanwhile, most of what subscriptions are used for is data that will never update. At least in our apps. It is a pure loss.\n\nThe use case is when you're connecting to third party systems that aren't as easily connected to the top level data tree.\n## Proposal\n\n``` js\nthis.forceDeepUpdate();\n```\n\nSame use case as `forceUpdate`, if you are reading from global mutable state for some reason, you can use this to by-pass `shouldComponentUpdate` in an entire subtree. Basically rerender everything. When combined with Fiber this can be a low-priority update so it's not so bad for things that change a lot of things.\n\nA good example would be changing the locale. Regardless if you read a global mutable locale (like AirBnB does) or a context locale (like Yahoo) does, this lets you change it when you need to. Without needing to manage subscriptions for all those cases when you don't need it.\n\n``` js\nthis.forceDeepUpdateWithScope(scope);\n```\n\n``` js\nclass Foo extends React.Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdateForScope(scope) {\n    return scope.store === UserStore && scope.id === this.props.userID;\n  }\n  render() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`forceDeepUpdateWithScope` would traverse the subtree and only start rendering if `shouldComponentUpdateForScope` returns `true` for the arbitrary `scope` argument. This allows for a bit more of a targeted update with some convenience overhead.\n\nAdditionally, React would cache the pair of `scope` and `components` that responded. For some number of scopes back. If a new component gets mounted with a `shouldComponentUpdateForScope` we might check it against the cache to see if we need to add it to the cache.\n\nEffectively this creates **lazy subscriptions**.\n\nThe use case is something like typing into an input field that then updates some global store which immediately displays in a completely different place on the page. The first character might be a bit slower but still with responsive levels and the subsequent characters are fast to update.\n## Caveat\n\nThe major downside of this proposal is that it relies on mutation. As we know, React doesn't really like mutation for many more reasons than just `shouldComponentUpdate`.\n\nThe effect in Fiber for example, is that any component that gets a higher priority update will start using the new value. Components that rely on mutable state effectively become up-prioritized which is not good. 1) It can temporarily show inconsistent data. 2) The point of making this kind of update lower priority is because it is likely to be large. Larger updates will stall the page if they take the same priority as higher priority updates. Thereby defeating the benefits of Fiber anyway.\n\nI'd like to try to come up with a variant of this API that doesn't rely on mutation.\n"

There is no way for us as developers to mark a prop as fixed (should never change over the lifecycle of a component).\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\n\nThese would _not_ be static properties, i.e. they can change from instance to instance. But they are created at initial render and never change (`===`) from the original. Ideally, though I'm not sure on implementation, they would also always be `deepEqual` to the original (perhaps something like `Object.freeze(Object.assign({}, originalObject))`.\n\nAdvantages to allowing props to be explicitly marked as fixed:\n1. shouldComponentUpdate would be better if a lot if certain props automatically don't / can't change\n2. Allow for errors / warnings when a prop marked as fixed is changed after the initial render.\n3. Possible compiler / render optimizations knowing that particular props will never change over the course of multiple renders. In particular, if a component only has fixed props (including children), we know the render output is fixed, and we can just inline that output into the parent render output.\n\nOne possible API would allow a separate fixedProps category.\n\n`React.createElement(MyComponent, { name: 'Hello' }, children, { message: 'Always this one string' })` (maintain signature)\n\nFor JSX, one (very mediocre) idea would be something like:\n`<MyComponent name=\"Hello\" $fixed.message=\"Always this one string\" />`\n\nAnother would be a separate prop called $fixed or something similar.\n\n`React.createElement(MyComponent, { name: 'Hello', $fixed: { message: 'Always this one string' } }, children)`\n`<MyComponent name=\"Hello\" $fixed={{ message: 'Always this one string' }} />`\n\nIt would be critical that `props` and `fixedProps` would be merged when the component is actually created. `this.props` would always contain all props, functional components still get one arg, and thus nobody has to rewrite render for any component.\n"

        "description": "React's shouldComponentUpdate based performance improvements work great for improving the performance of medium-weight components with large numbers of instances. They even work well with event handlers, as you can ignore event handler changes and instead pass a locally bound method that'll access `this.props.on*` on demand. However this all fails apart you start passing react elements to pure components.\n\n``` js\n'use strict';\nimport React, {Component, PropTypes} from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport shallowEqual from 'recompose/shallowEqual';\n// shallowEqualExcluding: Fictional function that works like shallowEqual, but ignores changes to a list of props passed as the third argument\n\nclass Button extends Component {\n    static propTypes = {\n        icon: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n        onClick: PropTypes.func\n    };\n\n    onClick = (e) => {\n        this.props.onClick(e);\n    };\n\n    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n        // @note Doesn't actually work\n        return shallowEqualExcluding(this.props, nextProps, ['onClick']);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const {icon} = this.props;\n\n        return (\n            <button onClick={this.onClick}>\n                {icon}\n                {/*React.cloneElement(icon, {ref: (icon) => this.iconRef = icon})*/}\n            </button>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nclass Icon extends Component {\n    static propTypes = {\n        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n        color: PropTypes.string\n    };\n\n    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n        return shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const {name, color} = this.props;\n        return getSvgIcon(name, color);\n    }\n}\n\nconst nilClick = () => {};\nReactDOM.render(<Button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')} icon={<Icon name='done'} />, document.querySelector('#container'));\nReactDOM.render(<Button onClick={nilClick} icon={<Icon name='done'} />, document.querySelector('#container')); // 2nd invovation\nReactDOM.render(<Button onClick={nilClick} icon={<Icon name='cancel'} />, document.querySelector('#container')); // 3rd invovation\n```\n\nGiven this sample; A `<Button />` component that expects an icon to be passed as an `icon` prop and a simple `<Icon />`. Both are pure components and Button is also coded to not re-render when`onClick` is changed. Pretend that Button actually has a heavy `render()` but its props and state don't change frequently.\n\nOn the second invocation, Icon should not require any prop change or render and Button should have its `onClick` prop changed but not require a render.\nOn the third invocation, Icon should require a render while Button itself does not need to render except for the change to Icon.\n\nHowever in practice Button will always re-render, including during the second invocation when nothing changes.\n\nThis is because `<Icon />` will always result in a new instance and will never be the same.\n\nNormally you could work around this within the component itself, without telling users they have to store `<Icon />` in a variable until they think they need to change its props; for functions you could pass a function that will use `this.props.*` itself and for objects you can do a deep comparison if you know the structure of the object. But for react elements, even though `shouldComponentUpdate` allows React to know if the current component has a render dependency on a sub-component, you do not have access to this information so Button cannot tell if Icon requires a render.\n\nIn practice this can turn out to be a problem when you're writing some libraries rather than an application. Notably [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) suffers from this problem in production. `EnhancedSwitch`'s `render()` is not light; `EnhancedSwitch` is used by `RadioButton` and `Checkbox`; both use a `checkedIcon` and `uncheckedIcon` React element prop; you can reasonably have 100 checkboxes on one page; even if they were pure, they cannot identify whether an icon requires an update; as a result, a render of the component containing the checkboxes to check a single checkbox will result in the `render()` of all 100 `EnhancedSwitch` instances.\n\nI can think of a few ideas on\u00a0what type of API could be added to React to solve this issue.\n## shouldComponentUpdate helper\n\nThe most obvious API would be a top-level React function that given the instance context, old ReactElement, and new ReactElement would return the result of a Component's `shouldComponentUpdate`. Then heavy parent components can use that to implement a `shouldComponentUpdate` that is aware of render dependencies in its children.\n(As a bonus, theoretically you could temporarily remember this while you're walking the current tree; then instead of calling `shouldComponentUpdate` multiple times for every (potentially nested) component the result is simply that `shouldComponentUpdate` calls are raised up to the highest level where a component is render-dependent on them)\n\n`React.shouldComponentUpdate(this, this.props.icon, nextProps.icon)`\n\nHowever I expect the problem we have with this is that `shouldComponentUpdate` is also responsible for state dependent updates and `this` is supposed to be a rendered instance, not a ReactElement instance. While you know `context` from passing the current instance, you do not have a reference to the state from either of the props.\n## ref based shouldComponentUpdate helper\n\nThe second most obvious API would be a `shouldComponentUpdate` helper that instead uses a ref.\n\n`React.shouldComponentUpdate(this.iconRef, nextProps.icon)`\n\nThe downside to this is that to get a ref for a component you didn't create, you inevitably have to use `React.cloneElement`.\n## render passthrough\n\nThe next idea I had was a render passthrough. A way during the render process for a component to say \"I do not need a render()/update, but these children of mine may\" which would tell React to skip render() and then run `shouldComponentUpdate` on the instances deeper in the tree.\n\nHowever those components only know if they need updates if you pass them the new props; so a passthrough won't work. We'd instead need a way to tell react that it should not run `render()` but do pass on an update to a specific component instance\n\n`this.renderRef(this.iconRef, nextProps.icon);`\n\nThe advantage of this over using `shouldComponentUpdate` is that instead of only allowing medium components wrapping light components to only `render()` when a child requires it; we also allow heavy components to never `render()` unless they themselves require it, while still allowing them to permit their light children to update.\n# partial renders\n\nThat `shouldComponentUpdate` based `renderRef` only applying updates to a component child feels somewhat awkward and forced though. So a more robust idea might be a partial render lifecycle that optionally runs when `shouldComponentUpdate => false` and can call for the render of a sub-tree that belongs to the current component.\n\n``` js\nclass HeavyComponent extends Component {\n    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n        // Ignore icon and children\n        return nextProps.text !== this.props.text;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const {text, icon, children} = this.props;\n\n        text = doSomethingAbsurdlyCpuIntensiveAndHardToFactorOutOfThisComponent(text);\n\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <h2>\n                    {React.cloneElement(icon, {ref: (icon) => this.iconRef = icon})}\n                    {text}\n                </h2>\n                <Wrapper ref='subtree'>\n                    {children}\n                </Wrapper>\n        );\n    }\n\n    componentSkippedRender(nextProps/*, nextState*/) {\n        this.subRender(this.iconRef, React.cloneElement(icon, {ref: (icon) => this.iconRef = icon}));\n\n        this.subRender(\n            this.refs.subtree,\n            <Wrapper ref='subtree'>\n                {children}\n            </Wrapper>\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThough `this.subRender` probably has potential for conflicts, so I expect the most react-line way to name that would be something like `React.renderSubtreeIntoComponent(parentComponent, nextElement, component)` which would be invoked using `React.renderSubtreeIntoComponent(this, /* subtree */, this.refs.subtree);`.\n\nThe `<Wrapper>` I used would be a really light component that probably would just render its children. It's there because `React.renderSubtreeIntoComponent` should probably not accept dom refs; this should be part of React lifecycle/walker, not part of client side browser only react-dom like `ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`.\n"

It's a general source of confusion (and bugs) to be able to set state in two different ways:\n- You MUST do `this.state = {}` if you're in the constructor\n- You MUST do `this.setState()` everywhere else.\n\nI believe it'd be much better to have just 1 way to set state in general, and it should be universal. If we're already accessing state through `this.state`, and setting state in the constructor with `this.state`, why not do it everywhere else?

        "description": "**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**\nBug - maybe intended behaviour.\n\n**What is the current behavior?**\n\n_Background_\nI have an app that needs to be embedded by other apps (other customers). The idea being \"our\" react app has its javascript loaded in an iframe, but the \"main\" window hosts dom elements from the customers and our react app. That bit works fine. As time goes on \"our\" react UI is no longer needed, and then react root is removed, and the iframe destroyed. These apps are often long lived so there will be times when the react app needs to appear again, and the iframe is recreated and everything reloaded. This can and will happen many times.\n\n_Goal_\nWe would like to NOT keep the iframe around when its not actually needed, but rather re-create just in time when it is needed. This app is used by customers and they would like to embed our \"react\" app, without interference with their \"app\" and all its javascript, which is why we are doing the iframe thing.\n\n_Problem_\nIt is evident by watching the chrome dev tools \"timeline\" memory graph that memory always increases each time a new iframe is created and the react UI is init'd. Unmounting and destroying the iframe, never causes the memory to drop to \"near\" original before load value. Repeating this process multiple times slowly show an increase memory.\n\nThis also causes a more immediate problem, in that react is throwing exceptions on every event (click, type etc) because the window of the iframe is now null.\n\n_Proof: First symptom - Event exceptions (only happens in my app)_\nThese exceptions only happen in my (cant share) app, i cant repo them, but parts of this apply to all react apps. Please read thru - it will all make sense when you get to the end and if you examine my poc.\n\nDestroying the Iframe, leaves React and its event dispatching system in memory. I have a  mixture of x-tag, webcomponents which are used to \"create\" the iframe and load the react app. After the custom element is used (lets call it <EMBED-REACT>), the console starts showing exceptions all within react code. This is a side effect of the react dispatchEvent still being active and trying to do stuff.\n\n``` javascript\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of null\nshouldUseChangeEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14296\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14536\nextractEvents @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:13000\nhandleTopLevel @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:19816\nhandleTopLevelImpl @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23870\nperform @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:15510\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23787\nbatchedUpdates @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:14673\ndispatchEvent @ VM1068_embeddedApp.js:23946\n```\n\nI know about `ReactEventListener.dispatchEvent`(snip below) where i can disable react( i havent actually tried) to avoid the exceptions, but that would leave the memory leak.\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/renderers/dom/client/ReactEventListener.js#158\n\n``` javascript\n dispatchEvent: function(topLevelType, nativeEvent) {\n    if (!ReactEventListener._enabled) {\n      return;\n    }\n```\n\nIts rather easy to prove that react remains in memory, simply goto the compiled app, find the `React dispatchEvent` and insert a console.log and watch as it continues to \"print\" stuff after unmounting the last component, even though there are no listeners. In my case the exception is caused because all `extractEvents` eventually default to \"window\" as the \"target\".\n\nThere are multiple copies of the same basic idea in various react functions, where it tries to get a target that it assumes will never be null. If one doesnt load react in an iframe, then window is always defined.\n\n``` javascript\nvar targetNode = targetInst ?\n      ReactDOMComponentTree.getNodeFromInstance(targetInst) : window;\n```\n\nLater the `shouldUseChangeEvent` tries to read the nodeName of the now \"undefined\" window, because its iframe has been destroyed, but that now results in an exception (null pointer etc).\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/045f1a791c6e17253e9d927ffca70ae5d00b4fe5/src/renderers/dom/client/eventPlugins/ChangeEventPlugin.js#L72 ...\n\n``` javascript\nfunction shouldUseChangeEvent(elem) {\n  var nodeName = elem.nodeName && elem.nodeName.toLowerCase();\n  return nodeName === 'select' || nodeName === 'input' && elem.type === 'file';\n}\n```\n\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/).**\n\n**What is the expected behavior?**\nThere are probably two possible solutions, that work in tandem.\n\n1) Firstly React should provide an API that will remove all its global event listeners. Naturally it could complain if there are any active components that remain mounted. This API may be internal/private (not public), if #2 was implemented. It might be called something like `React.shutdownAll` Because everything is gone, the next React render would setup all its globals again.\n\n2) React should dispose of all its global event handlers when the last or \"root\" component is unmounted. This would call the _new api_ mentioned in 1. \n\nEither option solves my problem, where i wish to either let react shutdown gracefully. With this in mind i could.\n- unmount iframe powered react ui component.\n- call React.disposeGlobals (mentioned above). If unmounting auto calls an internal `React.shutdownAll` then this step is skipped.\n- destroy iframe.\n\n_Proof #2_\nGoto your compiled out, locate the `dispatchEvent` and add a console.log, notice even after the last / root container is unmounted stuff will continue to be printed because the event listeners are still active.\n\nI did a very quick scan of the abstraction around adding listeners, and i couldnt see the remove function being stored and then called to cleanup.\n\n_Proof #3_\nLook at my last section below where i have a proof of concept form of the popular todomvc react example.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\nReact 15.0.2\nReact-Dom 15.0.2\nReact-redux 4.4.5 (might be useful to know)\n\n**Reproducable use case**\n\nSorry i tried but decided that using the facebook jsfiddle wasnt really a smart thing for the following reasons.\n- the compile the \"jsx\" content means loading babel etc to compile (babel, jsfiddle etc too many moving parts)\n- its \"hard\" to get the \"root component\" that is inserted into the \"output\" box and \n- its even just too \"hard\" to put the jsx compiled output into somewhere for the iframe src= to \"load\".\n\nI have forked the popular todomvc app and added a few minor edits to recreate, reload, render+unmount x100, destroy everything about the app, and try again in a loop separated by a sleep.\n- https://todomvc.com (todomvc main site)\n- https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc (todomvc github)\n- https://github.com/mP1/todomvc/pull/2 (my fork - with comments and snapshots of chrome dev tools timeline memory graph)\n\nHopefully we can trust the todomvc guys are doing the right thing, no dumb memory leaks. If you examine it should be obvious the only thing im adding is support for my horrible create app, run app, render+unmount many times, render, unmount, sleep a bit and then loop again until counter exhausted.\n\nSorry if this is boring but as a convenience i will list the basic instructions to \"run\" the react version of my branch on your local machines...\n1. clone https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc.git\n2. in the root, run \"gulp\", to compile everything.\n3. run something like \"python -m SimpleHTTPServer\"\n   4A. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index.html \n   4B. navigate to http://localhost:8000/examples/react/index3.html\n   // /examples/react corresponds to the dist/examples/react directory that gulp built into.\n\nMy poc supports 3 concepts.\n- re-run todomvc over and over again in \"same\" window.\n- create iframe, load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy iframe, try 20x\n- create custom element, webcontainer creates iframe and load todomvc js in the iframe but render to outer window, unmount, destroy custom element, try 20x\n\nIf you look at my p/r against todomvc you will see many helpful pictures with memory leak graphs from chrome dev tools for each of the 3 described scenarios and some commentary.\n"

        "description": "**Note: This is my personal proposal.**\n**Please don\u2019t announce it anywhere as \u201cReact dropping refs!\u201d** \ud83d\ude04 \n\nHigher order components solve many problems of mixins, however they come with their own problems. The most painful one in my experience is that they hide the ref of the wrapped component, so they can\u2019t be treated as transparent wrappers. This is well described in #4213.\n\nAs we prepare for de-emphasizing `createClass` and mixins I think it\u2019s important that we **treat higher order components as first class pattern in React, and provide full support for it without clashes with existing features**. This means we need to fix refs to work well with higher order components.\n\nIn the community, I see that people embrace stateless functional components even though they don\u2019t have public instances and don\u2019t support refs pointed at them. I think that this is a good indication that refs are moving from being a commonly needed feature to an escape hatch, and so it can be further de-emphasized by becoming opt-in.\n### What Doesn\u2019t Change\n\n`<div ref={...} />` works like before and provides node in a callback.\n`<StatelessFunctionalComponent ref={...} />` works like before and provides `null` in a callback.\n### Classes Opt Into Exposing a Ref\n\nIn the spirit of https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4213#issuecomment-115019321, I propose that **`this.ref` becomes an opt-in API on every class component.** If you want your components to be \u201creffable\u201d (that is, to expose their public instances as refs), you need to manually call it in your constructor:\n\n``` js\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    this.ref(this) // I'm exposing my public instance!\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n\n// Will print MyComponent instance\n<MyComponent ref={instance => console.log(instance)} />\n```\n### By Default, Don\u2019t Expose Refs\n\nIf you don\u2019t call `this.ref(this)` during the constructor, React will automatically call it with `null`:\n\n``` js\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  ...\n}\n\n// Will print null\n<MyComponent ref={instance => console.log(instance)} />\n```\n\nThis means that by default, class components will act just like functional components. There is no access to the instance unless the class opts in.\n### Automatic Cleanup\n\nIf the class opts in, it only needs to call `this.ref` in the constructor. React will take care of automatically calling it with `null` when the component unmounts.\n### New! Forwarding a Ref to Another Component\n\n**This is the new feature here.**\nSince we opt into refs, we can cleanly support ref forwarding for higher order components:\n\n``` js\nfunction wrap(WrappedComponent) {\n  return class extends Component {\n    ...\n\n    render() {\n      return <WrappedComponent ref={this.ref} />\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy passing `ref={this.ref}`, we let `WrappedComponent` supply its own instance, if available. This way the fact that it\u2019s wrapped with a higher order component becomes unobservable.\n\nThis also works fine if you conditionally switch between different components or delay rendering:\n\n``` js\nfunction wrap(WrappedComponent) {\n  return class extends Component {\n    ...\n\n    render() {\n      return this.state.isReady ? <Spinner /> : <WrappedComponent ref={this.ref} />\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet\u2019s say `isReady` is `false` initially. React would take care of calling `this.ref(null)` after the constructor ran (since it knows the constructor never called `this.ref(this)`). So initially the parent receives `null`, as expected.\n\nWhen `WrappedComponent` mounts, it will call `this.ref(this)` with its instance, which make it available to the parent. When `WrappedComponent` unmounts, React will call `this.ref(null)` for its instance, cleaning it up again.\n\nThe same works if we alternate between `<WrappedComponent ref={this.ref} />` and `<SomeOtherComponent ref={this.ref} />`.\n### Upsides\n#### Higher Order Components are Unobservable\n\nThis removes a common pain point in that wrapping a component with a HOC changes its public API.\n#### Refs are Further Discouraged\n\nBy making them opt-in, we better signal that you shouldn\u2019t use them for data flow. The component can also be certain that changing or removing an imperative method is not a breaking change because by default it doesn\u2019t expose the ref. If it exposes the ref, this is done intentionally.\n#### Providing Explicit Imperative APIs\n\nThe component may also choose to provide a subset of methods as its public API:\n\n``` js\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n    // I'm exposing just some stuff!\n    this.ref({\n      focus: this.focus.bind(this)\n    })\n  }\n\n  focus() { ... }\n  privateMethodIDontWantAnybodyToCall() { ... }\n}\n```\n\nThis lets the component choose _which_ methods it wants to expose imperatively, and which are still considered implementation details.\n### Downsides\n#### Migration Cost\n\nThis would be an easy enough codemod for most components (just add `this.ref(this)` to any class component). But it\u2019s still a cost considering some of those components are on npm and out of your control. Arguably most third party components don\u2019t provide imperative methods anyway, but this will cause some trouble.\n#### Potential for Misuse\n\nI can imagine people doing `this.ref(this)` and then `<WrappedComponent ref={this.ref} />` in the `render` method. This could get confusing but I don\u2019t see any easy way to prevent or warn about this.\n#### Too Much Freedom\n\nTechnically you\u2019d be able to pass `this.ref(42)`, `this.ref(findDOMNode(this))` or other weird things. Maybe we could limit possible values to React public instances and `null`. On the other hand, the ability to only provide a subset of methods as described in \u201cProviding Explicit Imperative APIs\u201d seems useful.\n### Other Considerations\n#### `this.props.ref`?\n\nWe could have provided `ref` inside `this.props` as `this.props.ref`. I would argue that we don\u2019t want to do this for two reasons:\n- We want React to still \u201cmanage\u201d it partially by calling `this.ref(null)` when component unmounts. Otherwise it\u2019s too easy to introduce memory leaks. Having magic behavior for one of the props would be unexpected.\n- We don\u2019t want `{...this.props}` to transfer the ref over to the child as that would be unexpected in most cases.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think?\n\ncc @facebook/react-core \n"

Right now our system is simple:\n### Current System\n#### Variables\n- `__DEV__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`\n#### Development Build (any `NODE_ENV` except `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `true`\n#### Production Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n\nAs you can see, if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is omitted, we assume `__DEV__` mode. This is a sensible assumption, and not the one we want to change, as most projects today don\u2019t specify anything as `NODE_ENV` in development, and we don\u2019t want them to suddenly lose all developer warnings.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following new system:\n### Proposed System\n#### Variables\n- `__DEV__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'profile' && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`\n- `__PROFILE__ = (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'profile'`)\n#### Development Build (any `NODE_ENV` except `'profile'` or `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `true`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `true`\n#### Profile Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'profile'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `true`\n#### Production Build (`NODE_ENV` is `'production'`)\n- `__DEV__` is `false`\n- `__PROFILE__` is `false`\n\nThis would let us have three separate build configurations. We can use the same pattern in other `fbjs` projects as well, if desired. I would say it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d ever want to add a separate fourth configuration so this should cover all our needs.\n\nAny thoughts why this would be a bad idea?

        "description": "At the moment, it is quite cumbersome to work with promises in React. Either you write a lot of code to update the state inside the `then()` callbacks or you use a library like [react-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-promise) which only works for children (not properties) because it is based on components.\n\nAnother option is to traverse the whole virtual dom and replace promises before they are passed to React. (I have read once a blog post about this but cannot find it any longer.) This is obviously not ideal for the rendering performance.\n\nSince promises are now a standard, I think there should be simpler way to use them directly in the view. One option would be to introduce an AsyncValue type with a Promise implementation. The AsyncValue type would then be supported for children as well as properties.\n\nPromises could then simply be used like this:\n\n``` javascript\n<div>{promise(this.state.myPromise)}</div>\n```\n\nOpposed to supporting promises everywhere (directly without the promise function), this should not have unexpected side effects. Moreover, other types of asynchronous values (for example Observables) could be added later easily just by creating another AsyncType implementation.\n\nAngular 2 takes a similar route with the [async pipe](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/pipes.html#!#the-impure-asyncpipe-). There you can simply write \n\n``` javascript\n{{ myPromise | async }}\n```\n\nin attributes as well as normal content.\n\nThis feature would also be very convinient for libraries like Flux because it allows to fetch properties directly inside the view and avoids the reptition which you have with Relay:\n\n``` javascript\n<div>{promise(this.state.model.get('property'))}</div>\n```\n\nWhat do you think about this proposal?\nHas this been discussed before? I couldn't find a thread which covers this particular topic.\n"

I.e. we don't catch typos. This is mostly a legacy artifact and there are many components out there that don't define their full set of props. E.g. when `...` spread is used. Few components also define the `children` prop even though they use it. Warning for all of these might be too much work initially.\n\nHowever, we can start small. We can find missing properties that have corresponding properties with a different case and suggest that the developer use that instead. This is essentially always a bug.\n\nWhile it is technically possible to have the same property name with two or more different case, it is considered bad practice to allow both. It causes overhead to test for both in the diffing/rendering. It causes style-guide issues where people have to pick which style to use. It also makes it worth for tooling where search/replace can easily miss less commonly used variants. That's why React only allows a single case, and ideally so should custom components.\n"

The react component model generally speaking offers a big opportunity to raise the often low bar for accessibility in the library and widget world, see experiments like @ryanflorence's react-a11y. \n\nFor better or for worse the aria, and a11y API's in the browser are heavily based on using ID's to link components together. `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-owns`,`aria-activedescendent`, and so on all need's ID's. In a different world we would just generate ids where needed and move on, however server-side rendering makes that complicated, because any generated ID is going to cause a mismatch between client/server.\n\nWe've tried a few different approaches to address some of this, one is making id's required props on components that need them. That gets kinda ugly in components that need a few id's but moreso it annoys users. Its unfortunate because if we could generate deterministic id's we could just provide more accessible components by default.\n\nThe frustrating part is that the component generally has all the information it needs to just set the various aria info necessary to make the component usable with a screen reader, but are stymied by not having the user provide a bunch of globally unique ids'\n\nSo far only really reasonable approaches I've seen are @syranide's solution of a root ID store, and using `_rootID`. The latter obviously has problems. The former doesn't scale well for library authors. Everyones' root App component is already wrapped in a Router, Provider, etc, having every library use their own root level ID provider is probably not super feasible and annoying to users.\n\nIt seems like the best way to do this would be if React (or a React addon) could just provide a consistent first class way to get a unique identifier for a component, even if it is just a base64 of the node's _rootID.\n\nthanks for all the hard work everyone!\n"

        "description": "React components could use some way to dynamically add a handler to be called on unmount. Either some event handler like way (`this.addUnmountHandler`) or some other way to register a 'destructor'/destroy method for an object that a component is holding on to.\n\n`componentWillUnmount` exists but it does not scale well.\n- Every time you hold on to something you have to maintain two sections of code, with the cleanup code being separate from the rest of the code.\n- If you try to cleanup your code using helpers adding the cleanup code could be done in the very same function. But `componentWillUnmount` doesn't allow that.\n- Sometimes you end up adding a `this._fooSomethingProp` to a component you wouldn't normally need, just so that you can hold on to the destructor for use in `componentWillUnmount` because you can't add the cleanup code in the same closure you set it up in.\n\n---\n\nHere's one sample use case of mine for unmount handlers.\n\nReact is discouraging the use of mixins so I've been trying to move towards alternative patterns in new code. Some helpers only make sense on a component itself and wont work as a special component or a higher-order component.\n\nFor some of these needs I've come up with a pattern that involves passing the component to a helper function that will mutate the component and provide some sort of service which is linked to the component.\n\nTwo examples from my codebase:\n\n`ctxApi` provides a component with a version of my internal api which is 'scoped' to the component so that if the component is unmounted all of the api requests' HTTP requests are aborted.\n\n`setPending` adds a key to a pending state set and returns a `pending.cleanup` that will unset it, which is intended to be passed to a `.finally` handler. This pattern provides my buttons, etc... with pending text and spinners while waiting for HTTP requests.\n\n``` js\nresendConfirmation(email) {\n    var pending = setPending(this, `${email}:resendConfirmation`);\n\n    ctxApi(this)\n        .then((api) => api.post('/self/resendConfirmationEmail', {email}))\n        .then(() => alertifyjs.notify(\"Confirmation message sent\"))\n        .fin(pending.cleanup)\n        .catch(ignoreAbort)\n        .catch(notifyOnError)\n        .done();\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is that these helpers often need cleanup on unmount. `ctxApi` needs to abort requests on unmount. And `setPending` needs to break references so `setState` isn't called and it doesn't prevent gc. And while I can require that a call to a cleanup function be placed into `componentWillUnmount`. That is unnecessary boilerplate and easy to forget.\n\nIt would be much preferable for these helpers to be able to register an unmount handler on the component instance so they can implicitly clean themselves up.\n"

This breaks on older browsers unless the developer globally polyfills `Symbol`, because `Symbol` will be polyfilled automatically by Babel in the user's code, but will not be polyfilled in the React library. This causes `ReactElement.isValidElement` to fail as `Symbol.for('react.element') !== 0xeac7`.\n\nWorse, this bug only occurs in older browsers that don't implement Symbol, meaning that many devs won't catch it right away as it will work fine in FF, Chrome, and (latest) Safari.\n\nThis is a hard issue to fix without globally polyfilling Symbol or giving up on the use of `Symbol` for `$$typeof`. Babel could automatically this as part of enabling the optimisation, but @loganfsmyth had a better idea - how about a `React.elementFromObject()` API?\n\nThis function would be nothing more than:\n\n``` js\nReact.elementFromObject = function(obj) {\n  invariant(obj && typeof obj === 'object', \"Supply an object to React.elementFromObject.\");\n  obj.$$typeof = REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE;\n  return obj;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that the `REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE` we are using is equal to the one used in `ReactElement.isValidElement`. It shouldn't be necessary to do any validation in `elementFromObject` because it will be caught by `isValidElement` later on.\n\nThoughts?\n"

The browser loads the app, slowly, which rehydrates its state and bootstraps over the form\n4. The user hits a save button\n\nAt this point, React has found no reason to rerender the form or throw a warning, even though the values of the form elements have been updated by the user before the app was listening to them. As a result, app state is out of sync with form input values. The user has just re-saved their old data (app state), but sees their new data (form values). If they leave, they lose their changes even though it appears that they just successfully saved.\n\nI have decided to solve the problem by putting a ref on every form input, and copying their values into app state on `componentDidMount`. I can probably make the solution a little more DRY than that sounds at first.\n\nI'm thinking that a better solution might be to have React include input values in the checksums. Is there a technical reason why this is not how isomorphic rendering already works?\n"

They may be made of several levels of children and components. For example one could be the entire page contents and the other the sidebar, while this `render()` is the page root.\n\n``` jsx\nrender() {\n    var blockA = <div>AAA</div>,\n        blockB = <div>BBB</div>;\n\n    if ( this.props.layoutA ) {\n        return <div>\n            <div className=\"something\">{blockB}</div>\n            <div className=\"something\">{blockA}</div>\n        </div>;\n    } else {\n        return <div>\n            {blockA}\n            {blockB}\n        </div>;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBecause the blocks aren't at the same level React cannot see the relation between these blocks and `key` cannot be used to give React any hints. As a result, when `layoutA` is changed, instead of the two blocks being moved to their new location the entire page is essentially completely unrendered and then re-rendered from scratch.\n\nI understand why this is the case. It would be far to expensive for React to be able to detect movement of nodes like this.\n\nBut I do believe we need a pattern to hint to React that this component has large blocks that may be moved around at different levels.\n\nNote that there may be a component in between the rendering component root and the block. So parent semantics scoped to the nearest component won't work. This'll need owner scoping.\n\nI understand that React is trying to eliminate the need for React.createElement to be used and owner scoping within special attributes interferes with that. So instead of a component scoped `key=\"\"` variant I think a method/object style interface kind of like `React.addons.createFragment` might work.\n"

Disclaimer: I'm trying to do sort of sketchy things, and I know this isn't supported, but I think it would be nice.\n\nI'm writing a library that I want to support react output optionally. To do this, right now I'm trying to inline all my ReactElements, such as\n\n``` javascript\n    return {\n        type: 'hr',\n        key: state.key,\n        _isReactElement: true\n    };\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n``` javascript\n    React.createElement('hr', {\n        key: state.key\n    })\n```\n\nThis is almost completely functional, except for the `_store` validation in react dev mode. This is because right now these literals don't have a `_store` key with `.validated` or `.originalProps`, which are assumed by the validators in React **DEV**. I can work around this, but to do so without duplicating props will have to write a wrapper function to create the element, which is a little unideal and slower (and adds unnecessary keys in non-dev mode).\n\nWould it be reasonable to short circuit some of these checks so that they only happen if _store is actually present on the ReactElement? If so, I'd be happy to submit a pull request (no rush for react 0.13 though).\n\nCurious as to your thoughts. Thanks!\nAria\n"

It would be nice if one could run separate tests with `jsdom` without manually cleaning up the `window` every time.\nAnother use case is for programatic behaviour inspection. It's interesting to load multiple windows with `jsdom` and compare the behavior of one's library with different calls. If React is involved, however, this is impossible.\n\nAvoiding relying on globals can be added in a backwards-compatible fashion. If there is a global `window` and `document`, keep the existing behavior. If there isn't, instead of exposing an API, expose a factory taking a `window` and returning an API. For example, see how [jQuery did it](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/intro.js#L25).\n\nA decision to avoid globals means refactoring existing code base to pass `window` explicitly everywhere, and maintaining that attitude in the future.

Both tools use a singleton object that is referenced and/or modified by components.\n\nI know I could create the object in the root component and pass it down as a prop but the child components may modify the object and that violates the idea of props being read-only.  It also means that if another person open sources a component which uses either of my tools that the user of the component must create that root object in their app and then wire it up down the component tree.\n\nTo keep things clean I would love to have a 3rd party extension space hanging off the React object that I could attach my tool's \"globals\" to so that all the components would have access to it given that they all share the same React global.  My suggestion is just to name it \"x\" and make it a bare object.  The documentation would encourage users to then add their own namespace to the object.\n\nHere are is very simple example that adds a 3rd party global event bus to a blogging app using EventEmitter which could be used both on the server and on the client via Browserify.\n\nIn app.js (the root component):\n\n```\nrequire('react-x-event');\n\nReact.x.event.bus.on('createPost', ...)\n```\n\nIn react-x-event.js\n\n```\nvar events = require('events');\nReact.x.event = {\n  bus: new events.EventEmitter(),\n  handle: function (e, event, data) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    React.x.event.bus.emit(event, data)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn new-post.js (a component view shown at some point by a sub-component of app.js)\n\n```\ncreatePost: function(e) {\n  React.x.event.handle(e, 'createPost', ...)\n}\n\nrender: function () {\n  return <form>\n    ...\n   <button onClick={this.createPost}>Create</button>\n  </form>;\n}\n```\n\nWithout getting lost in the weeds arguing if a global event bus is a good idea for React you can see in this example that I didn't need to wire up the component tree with the bus to allow the sub-component to send a message.  \n\nThere is nothing from stopping me or anyone else from just globally patching the React object to add the x member but I think it would be better to have it \"blessed\" and added to the React code so that there are no conflicts in the future over that member name.  I also think having a common name like 'x' will allow 3rd party module names to announce how they work, eg require('react-x-event').\n"

However, the reusability of such solutions is not often quite optimal.\n\nThere are solutions such as [GSS](http://gridstylesheets.org/) that allow you to define things like this in a reusable manner, they're usually supported only in the most recent browsers (which would be easier to solve for React-based solutions, since virtual DOM doesn't depend on the browser) and also hooking them up to possible changes in the tree is tedious and hard to get right without sacrificing performance.\n\nAllowing user-code to pre-process the virtual DOM tree before the diffing would open the doors for a whole new world of styling engines to born into, where reading from the virtual DOM tree is fast, as well as making changes to it. The implications vary from styling languages being able to define custom values such as `aspect-ratio` to apply a CSS aspect ratio hack, or inject extra DOM elements to make things centered based on the `className` of the element, while keeping the user-code intent-oriented and clear, abstracting away the common pains of CSS.\n\nI realize that this is not a simple change of adding a hook somewhere, but instead means exposing a vast amount of API surface that's currently considered implementation details. This is also even more problematic in cases where `shouldComponentUpdate` is involved. However, I think this would have the potential to revolutionize how we deal with styling web pages, so I'd say it's worth thinking through at least.\n"

Server-rendering should be able to generate optimal markup for SEO, markup must also be fully cross-browser compatible and small markup is preferable.\n2. Client-rendering sees SEO as largely irrelevant, full cross-browser compatibility is also irrelevant and rendering performance is of greater importance.\n\nSo I propose that we treat server-rendering as uniquely distinct from client-rendering, e.g. as a separate flag`React.serverSide = true` (which would default to true if document is not available). It's even imaginable that we could extend this with e.g. `React.targetClient = 'SEO' / 'legacyClient' / 'everGreenClient'`, which would optionally allow the markup to be tailored for a specific purpose.\n\nSo when reusing server-rendered markup client-side:\n1. The client should do an initial server-rendering pass being passed the exact same props (and time) as during the server-side rendering, but instances are actually allocated on the client.\n2. Immediately afterwards a client-rendering pass is done with any props (and current time) you like, instances/markup is efficiently reused and should not add significant costs as little DOM manipulation should be involved.\n\nI'm not really affected by this, but for those that do use server-rendering; this seems like the _correct_ way of approaching it (as opposed to just rendering everything exactly the same). However, I'm working on `img`\\- and `picture`-element polyfills, but without this they cannot be made to generate sensible server-side markup.\n\n**PS. I realize this can be done today using a global + mixin**, but without a standardized solution, it's unlikely that third-party (and polyfill) components could ever participate in this. But that doesn't mean that it needs to be shipped with React even (none of this requires core support I believe), as long as it's standardized.\n"

This way we can write:\n\n``` html\nrender: function(props, state) {\n  return <div>{props.something}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nWhile most of the time we'll still call `render(this.props, this.state)` internally, with this we will be able to do `render(somePrevProps, someTestState)` from React or even from the user. Being able to \"test the water\" would be very valuable in the future. For example:\n\n``` js\ncomponentWillReceiveProps: function(nextProps) {\n  var result1 = this.render(this.props, this.state);\n  var result2 = this.render(nextProps, this.state);\n  // Collection of changed stuff. Good for preparing mounting/unmounting animations or such logic.\n  React.reconciler.getDiff(result1, result2);\n  this.setState({...});\n}\n```\n\nI've heard this can also solve some problems with pendingState? Not too familiar with the issue.\n@jordwalke @sebmarkbage @petehunt \n"

[From MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.dataset):\n\n```\n<div id=\"user\" data-id=\"1234567890\" data-user=\"johndoe\" data-date-of-birth>John Doe\n</div>\n\nvar el = document.querySelector('#user');\n\n// el.id == 'user'\n// el.dataset.id === '1234567890'\n// el.dataset.user === 'johndoe'\n// el.dataset.dateOfBirth === ''\n\nel.dataset.dateOfBirth = '1960-10-03'; // set the DOB.\n\n// 'someDataAttr' in el.dataset === false\n\nel.dataset.someDataAttr = 'mydata';\n// 'someDataAttr' in el.dataset === true\n```\n\nWe should just start supporting `dataSet` (because camelCase). This will allow a couple things:\n- easier reasoning about data attributes (`Object.keys(this.props.dataSet)`)\n- easier merging (`<div dataSet={merge(this.props.dataSet, {extra: 'value', override: 'value'})} />`)\n- easier (potentially faster?) updates (just modify `node.dataset`)\n\nWe'll want to do the reverse of what the DOM is doing. eg `<div dataSet={{dateOfBirth: 'val', foo: 'bar'}} />` becomes `<div data-date-of-birth=\"val\" data-foo=\"bar\"></div>`.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, `aria-*` doesn't have a corresponding API, but we should make it work the same way. I think `ariaSet` makes sense.\n"
